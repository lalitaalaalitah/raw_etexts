 श्री जयेन्द्रसरस्वती श्लोकमालिका   
  
Stotram on Pujya Shri Jayendra Saraswathi Swamiji  
by Pujya Shri Shankara Vijayendra Saraswathi Swamiji  
          Translation by P. R. Kannan  
  
      भजेऽहं भगवत्पादं भारतीयशिखामणिम् ।  
      अद्वैतमैत्रीसद्भावचेतनायाः प्रबोधकम् ॥ १॥  
I adore Shri Adi Shankara Bhagavatpada, the crest-jewel of  
Bharatiyas; who awakened the feeling of friendship and goodwill  
stemming from Advaita (non-duality). (1)  
  
      अष्टषष्टितमाचार्यं वन्दे शङ्कररूपिणम् ।  
      चन्द्रशेखरयोगीन्द्रं योगलिङ्गप्रपूजकम् ॥ २॥  
I pay obeisance to Shri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi, the  
68th Acharya, the very form of Siva, the lord among Yogis;  
who worshipped Yogalinga.  (Yogalinga is one of the five  
sphatika lingas brought by Adi Shankaracharya from Kailasa and  
established by him in Kanchi Kamakoti Shrimatham). (2)  
  
      वरेण्यं वरदं शान्तं वदान्यं चन्द्रशेखरम् ।  
      वाग्मिनं वाग्यतं वन्द्यं विशिष्टाचारपालकम् ॥ ३॥  
I worship Shri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi, who is supreme,  
boon-giver, tranquil, munificent, eloquent and at the same time  
restrained in speech, worthy of worship, excellent protector  
of good conduct norms. (3)  
  
      देवे देहे च देशे च भक्त्यारोग्यसुखप्रदम् ।  
      बुधपामरसेव्यं तं श्रीजयेन्द्रं नमाम्यहम् ॥ ४॥  
I worship Shri Jayendra Saraswathi, who is the bestower of  
devotion to Iswara, good health and comfort in the country;  
and who is adored by all people from the wise to the  
dull-witted. (4)  
  
      वृत्तवृत्तिप्रवृत्तीनां कारणं करणं प्रभुम् ।  
      गुरुं नौमि नताशेषनन्दनं नयकोविदम् ॥ ५॥  
I worship my Guru Shri Jayendra Saraswathi, who is the maker of  
history, moulder of conduct (or profession), lord of destiny  
(or attitude); who delights everyone who prostrates; and who  
is prudent in policymaking. (5)  
  
      प्रजाविचारधर्मेषु नेतारं निपुणं निधिम् । वन्देऽहं  
      शङ्कराचार्यं श्रीजयेन्द्रसरस्वतीम् ॥ ६॥  
I worship Shankaracharya Shri Jayendra Saraswathi, who leads  
and guides all people, who is master of thoughtful enquiry,  
and who is treasure of Dharma. (6)  
  
      सितासितसरिद्रत्नमज्जनं मन्त्रवित्तमम् ।  
      दानचिन्तामणिं नौमि निश्चिन्तं नीतिकोकिलम् ॥ ७॥  
I worship Shri Jayendra Saraswathi, who bathes in the white and  
blue coloured jewels among rivers, Ganga and Yamuna; who is the  
best among knowers of mantras; who is verily Chintamani (gem  
which yields all desired objects) in charity; who is free from  
thought (or anxiety); who is the cuckoo spreading ethics. (7)  
  
      सरस्वतीगर्भरत्नं सुवर्णं साहसप्रियम् ।  
      लक्ष्मीवत्सं लोलहासं नौमि तं दीनवत्सलम् ॥ ८॥  
I worship Shri Jayendra Saraswathi, the jewel from the womb of  
Saraswathi; golden in fame; who likes bold and quick action;  
who is the child of Lakshmi; whose smile is enchanting;  
who is kind to the poor. (8) Saraswathi is the name of Shri  
Acharya’s mother; but he is also the child of Lakshmi in  
that his magical touch turns everything into gold.  
  
      गतिं भारतदेशस्य मतिं भारतजीविनाम् ।  
      वन्दे यतिं साधकानां पतिमद्वैतदर्शिनाम् ॥ ९॥  
I worship Yati Shri Jayendra Saraswathi, the destination of  
Bharatadesa, the intellect of those living in Bharatadesa;  
the master of aspirants eager to realise Advaita.  
  
      इति श्रीशङ्करविजयेन्द्रसरस्वतीशङ्कराचार्यस्वामिभिः  
      विरचिता श्री जयेन्द्रसरस्वती श्लोकमालिका ।  
Thus ends the garland of verses on Shri Jayendra Saraswathi  
Swamiji, composed by Shankaracharya Shri Shankara Vijayendra  
Saraswathi Swamiji.  
  
                   ॐ तत् सत्
