 कार्तवीर्य द्वादशनामस्तोत्रम्   
  
कार्तवीर्यार्जुनो नाम राजा बाहुसहस्रवान् ।  
तस्य स्मरणमात्रेण गतं नष्टं च लभ्यते ॥ १॥  
  
कार्तवीर्यः खलद्वेषी कृतवीर्यसुतो बली ।  
सहस्रबाहुः शत्रुघ्नो रक्तवासा धनुर्धरः ॥ २॥  
  
रक्तगन्धो रक्तमाल्यो राजा स्मर्तुरभीष्टदः ।  
द्वादशैतानि नामानि कार्तवीर्यस्य यः पठेत् ॥ ३॥  
  
सम्पदस्तत्र जायन्ते जनस्तत्र वशं गतः ।  
आनयत्याशु दूरस्थं क्षेमलाभयुतं प्रियम् ॥ ४॥  
  
कार्तवीर्य महाबाहो सर्वदिष्टविबर्हण ।  
सर्वं रक्ष सदा तिष्ठ दुष्टान्नाशय पाहि माम् ॥ ५॥  
  
सहस्रबाहुसशरं महितं  
सचापं रक्ताम्बरं रक्तकिरीटकुण्डलम् ।  
चोरादि-दुष्टभय-नाशं इष्टदं तं  
ध्यायेत् महाबल-विजृम्भित-कार्तवीर्यम् ॥ ६॥  
  
यस्य स्मरणमात्रेण सर्वदुःखक्षयो भवेत् ।  
यन्नामानि महावीर्यश्चार्जुनः कृतवीर्यवान् ॥ ७॥  
  
हैहयाधिपतेः स्तोत्रं सहस्रावृत्तिकारितम् ।  
वाञ्चितार्थप्रदं नृणां स्वराज्यं सुकृतं यदि ॥ ८॥  
  
   ॥  इति कार्तवीर्य द्वादशनाम स्तोत्रम् ॥  
  
Note:-  
(1) Srimad Bhagavatam says a few lines about Arjuna (he was the  
son of Kritavirya and hence called Kartaviryarjuna), in verses 23 to 27 in  
chapter 23, Book9. The verses and their rough translations are given here.   
    अर्जुनः कृतवीर्यस्य सप्तद्वीपेश्वरोऽभवत् ।  
    दत्तात्रेयाद्धरेरंशात् प्राप्तयोगमहागुणः ॥  
  
    न नूनं कार्तवीर्यस्य गतिं यास्यन्ति पार्तिवाः ।  
    यज्ञदानतपोयोगश्रुतवीर्यजयादिभिः ॥  
  
    पञ्चाशीतिसहस्राणि ह्यव्याहतबलःसमाः ।  
    अनष्टवित्तस्मरणो बुभुजेऽक्षय्यषड्वसु ॥  
  
    तस्य पुत्रसहस्रेषु पञ्चैवोर्वरिता मृधे ।  
    जयध्वजः शूरशेनो वॄषभो मधुरूर्जितः ॥  
  
Arjuna, the son of Kritavirya  became the ruler of the entire world with  
its seven continents. From his guru Sri Dattatreya he attained a part  
manifestation of Sri Hari. He became an expert yogi and was blessed with  
the siddhis (mystic powers). No other king could be compared with Arjuna  
in valour, munificence, asceticism, wisdom and other virtues. He ruled  
for 85,000 years and enjoyed all the pleasures. His strength (of body,  
mind and senses) remained unimpaired. His very remembrance proves to be  
a security against loss of wealth. He had a thousand sons. All of them,  
except five, were killed by Parasurama.  One of Arjuna's descendants  
was Yadu.  Yadu's descendants were known as Yadavas.  
  
(2):- Arjuna or Kartaviryarjuna, as he is popularly known, also finds a  
mention in the Uttara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana. (chapters 31 - 33).  
Sage Agastya narrates the story of Ravana to Rama.  
Ravana did severe penance and as a result got great powers from Brahma.  
He felt he was invincible.  He could defeat anyone he came across  
with ease.  He became puffed up with pride and was looking out  
for someone with whom he can have a good fight.  
He went to the city of Mahishmati, the city on the banks of river Narmada,  
from where Arjuna ruled.  Soon, he got into a severe fight with Arjuna.  
Ravana was hit on his chest by Arjuna and fell down crying. Arjuna  
trussed him up and imprisoned him.  Sage Pulastya, the grand father of  
Ravana, heard of Ravana's defeat and subsequent imprisonment by Arjuna.  
He felt pity for Ravana's condition and came to Mahishmati and requested  
Arjuna to release Ravana.  Arjuna immediately acceded to the request and  
released Ravana. Later both Arjuna and Ravana entered into an treaty  
of friendship.  Another version of the stotram containing his twelve  
names is given below.  
  
    कार्तवीर्यः सहस्राक्षः कृतवीर्यसुतः बली ।  
    सहस्रबाहुः शत्रुघ्नः रक्तवासा धनुर्धरः ॥ १॥  
  
    रक्तगन्धो रक्तमाल्यः राजा स्मर्तुरभीष्टदः ।  
    द्वादशैतानि नामानि कार्तवीर्यस्य यः स्मरेत् ॥ २॥  
  
    अनष्टद्रव्यता तस्य नष्टस्य पुनरागमः ।  
    सम्पदस्तस्य जायन्ते जनास्तस्य वशो सदा ॥ ३॥  
  
  
These verses say that one who remembers the twelve names of the great  
Arjuna, son of Kritavirya, will be blessed with prosperity.  
He will draw (attract) people to him. He will not lose his wealth or  
property by theft etc., and will also get back the money that  
he had lost.
