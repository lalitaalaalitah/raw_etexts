 श्रीदयानन्दपञ्चकम्   
  
सदा स्मेरवक्त्रं कृपापूर्णनेत्रं स्थिरं दीनमित्रं जनप्रीतिपात्रम् ।  
सुविज्ञातशास्त्रं कषायाक्तवस्त्रं दयानन्दरूपं मदाचार्यमीडे ॥ १॥   
I worship my Guru Swami Dayananda Saraswati (an  
embodiment of compassion and ananda), who has an  
ever smiling face, whose eyes are full of compassion,  
who is a steady friend of the helpless, who is loved by  
all people, who is well-versed in the scriptures and who  
is in ochre-robe. 1  
  
परब्रह्मनिष्ठं स्वतो धर्मनिष्ठं अहिंसैकनिष्ठं स्वशिष्यैः सुजुष्टम् ।  
यतीनां वरिष्ठं गुरूणाङ्गरिष्ठं दयानन्दरूपं मदाचार्यमीडे ॥ २॥   
I worship my Guru Swami Dayananda Saraswati, who  
is established in parabrahma, who abides by dharma  
spontaneously, who follows ahimsa without  
compromise, who is deeply adored by his (numerous)  
disciples, who is the noblest among saints and who is  
the greatest among teachers. 2  
  
सुशास्त्रे चरन्तं सदा सञ्चरन्तं जनान् बोधयन्तं भवादुद्धरन्तम् ।  
मठांस्थापयन्तं गुरून् पूजयन्तं दयानन्दरूपं मदाचार्यमीडे ॥ ३॥   
I worship my Guru Swami Dayananda Saraswati who  
(always) revels in the sacred scriptures, who is  
constantly on the move, who shares his wisdom with  
the people, who uplifts (all) from samsara, who is  
establishing institutions for scriptural learning and who  
worships his Gurus. 3  
  
कलानां प्रचारं दधानं विनम्रं स्वयं ग्रन्थकारं सतां मानितारम् ।  
नमत्तापहारं स्वयं निर्विकारं दयानन्दरूपं मदाचार्यमीडे ॥ ४॥   
I worship my Guru Swami Dayananda Saraswati who e  
promotes all forms of arts, who remains modest, who is  
an author and composer, who honours all great people,  
who alliviates the pains of the afflicted and who himself  
remains undisturbed. 4  
  
सदा शान्तमूर्तिं सदा क्षान्तिमूर्तिं सदा दान्तिमूर्तिं सदा सत्यमूर्तिम् ।  
प्रमाणप्रवृत्तिं दिशन्तं सुकीर्तिं दयानन्दरूपं मदाचार्यमीडे ॥ ५॥   
I worship my Guru Swami Dayananda Saraswati who is  
ever the embodiment of peace, accommodation,  
restraint and truthfulness, who (clearly) unfolds the  
function of pramanas and who is world-famous. 5  
  
इदम्पञ्चकं यः पठेच्छुद्धचित्तः सदा मोक्षमार्गे नितान्तं प्रवृत्तः ।  
प्रसादात् स शास्तुर्भवेज्ज्ञानयुक्तः स जीवन्मृतो वा भवेन्नित्यमुक्तः ॥   
One who is steadily and sincerely engaged in the  
pursuit of moksa and who reads these five verses will  
be blessed with knowledge by the grace of Guru.  
Whether living or dead, he will ever free.
