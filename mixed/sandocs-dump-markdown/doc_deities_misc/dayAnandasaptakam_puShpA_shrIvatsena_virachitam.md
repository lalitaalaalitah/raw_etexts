everything; the one who always teaches the Supreme Truth –  
That Thou Art; the one who teaches that  Brahman is the Essence  
of the Veda; the incarnation of compassion and happiness,  
I adore that great sage. 1  
  
The one who is devoid of ego; the one who is always absorbed  
in the Self that is Brahman; the one who is skilled in teaching  
the One Truth that is the unborn Source; the one who is expert  
in teaching the Gita sung by the Lord who has no beginning;  
the incarnation of compassion and happiness, I adore that  
great sage. 2  
  
The one whose abode is by the Ganga; the one whose association  
is with the virtuous renunciation; the one who is devoid of  
attachment to riches; the one who always adheres to the Supreme;

in his country, proclaims one’s  dharma; travels abroad,  
teaching in far away countries; the incarnation of compassion  
and happiness, I adore that great sage. 5  
  
The one who lives for hundreds of years; the one who is  
propitious; the unique and choicest  sannyasin; the one whose  
teaching is on the acquisition of wealth of knowledge bequeathed  
by our preceptors; the one whose is the one path of  suj~nAna  
which alone confers  mukti; the incarnation of compassion and  
happiness, I adore that great sage. 6
