 श्रीहनुमत् पञ्चरत्नम्   
  
.. Garland of Five Gems on Shri Hanuman ..  
Translation by A. Narayanaswami  
 वीताखिल-विषयेच्छं जातानन्दाश्र पुलकमत्यच्छम् ।  
 सीतापति दूताद्यं वातात्मजमद्य भावये हृद्यम् ॥ १॥   
 I now call to mind Hanuman, the son of the wind god,  
gladdening to contemplate, who is free of all sensual  
desires, who sheds tears of joy and is filled with rapture, who  
is the purest of the pure and the first of Rama's messengers. 1.   
  
 तरुणारुण मुख-कमलं करुणा-रसपूर-पूरितापाङ्गम् ।  
 सञ्जीवनमाशासे मञ्जुल-महिमानमञ्जना-भाग्यम् ॥ २॥   
 I think of Hanuman, whose face is like the lotus, red like  
the rising sun, the corners of whose eyes are full of the  
feeling of mercy, who is life-giving, whose greatness  has  
the quality of beauty, who personifies Anjana's good fortune.  2.   
  
 शम्बरवैरि-शरातिगमम्बुजदल-विपुल-लोचनोदारम् ।  
 कम्बुगलमनिलदिष्टम् बिम्ब-ज्वलितोष्ठमेकमवलम्बे ॥ ३॥   
 I seek refuge in the one who flies faster than the  
arrows of madana, whose eyes wide as the petals of the lotus  
are filled with kindness, whose neck is smooth and  
well-formed as the conch shell, who represented good  
fortune to the wind god, and whose lips are bright-red  
like the bimba fruit. 3.   
  
 दूरीकृत-सीतार्तिः प्रकटीकृत-रामवैभव-स्फूर्तिः ।  
 दारित-दशमुख-कीर्तिः पुरतो मम भातु हनुमतो मूर्तिः ॥ ४॥   
 May the form of Hanuman come resplendent before me, the  
one that dispelled Sita's grief, that brought out the glory of  
Shri Rama's prowess, that tore Ravana's reputation into shreds. 4.   
  
 वानर-निकराध्यक्षं दानवकुल-कुमुद-रविकर-सदृशम् ।  
 दीन-जनावन-दीक्षं पवन तपः पाकपुञ्जमद्राक्षम् ॥ ५॥   
 I saw the leader of the Vanara (monkey) populace, the one  
who was (inimical) like the sun's rays to the (night-blooming)  
lily of the Danava people (the demonic race), who is  
dedicated to the protection of those in distress, who  
was the culmination of the accumulated penances of Vayu. 5.   
  
 एतत्-पवन-सुतस्य स्तोत्रं  
      यः पठति पञ्चरत्नाख्यम् ।  
 चिरमिह-निखिलान् भोगान् भुङ्क्त्वा  
      श्रीराम-भक्ति-भाग्-भवति ॥ ६॥   
 He who recites this hymn to Hanuman, entitled ᳚Pancharatnam,᳚  
will become one with the devotees of Shri Rama after enjoying  
for long the pleasures of this world.  6.   
  
 इति श्रीमच्छङ्कर-भगवतः कृतौ हनुमत्-पञ्चरत्नं सम्पूर्णम् ॥  
 Here ends ᳚Hanumat Pancharatnam,᳚ composed by Shri  
Shankara Bhagavata, Adi Shankaracarya.
