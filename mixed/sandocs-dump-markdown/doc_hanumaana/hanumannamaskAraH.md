 श्रीहनुमन्नमस्कारः   
  
.. Obeisance to Shri Hanuman ..  
Translation by A. Narayanaswami  
    गोष्पदी-कृत-वारीशं मशकी-कृत-राक्षसम् ।  
    रामायण-महामाला-रत्नं वन्देऽनिलात्मजम् ॥ १॥  
 I make obeisance to the son of Vayu (the Wind God),   
who tamed the vast ocean into a hoof-print (in   
the mud), turned the demons into mosquitoes, and is   
the gem in the great garland that the Ramayana is. 1.   
  
    अञ्जना-नन्दनं-वीरं जानकी-शोक-नाशनम् ।  
    कपीशमक्ष-हन्तारं वन्दे लङ्का-भयङ्करम् ॥ २॥  
 I make obeisance to the hero who gladdened   
Anjana (his mother), the destroyer of Sita's sorrow,   
the lord of the monkeys, the slayer of (Ravana's son)   
AkSha, and a terror to (the inhabitants of) Lanka.  2.   
  
    महा-व्याकरणाम्भोधि-मन्थ-मानस-मन्दरम् ।  
    कवयन्तं राम-कीर्त्या हनुमन्तमुपास्महे ॥ ३॥  
 I worship Hanuman whose intellect, like the   
Mandara mountain (which was used to churn the ocean   
of milk for nectar) acted as the churning rod for the   
great ocean of the science of grammar,   
and who keeps praising the fame of Rama. 3.   
  
    उल्लङ्घ्य सिन्धोः सलिलं सलीलं  
           यः शोक-वह्निं जनकात्मजायाः ।  
    आदाय तेनैव ददाह लङ्कां  
           नमामि तं प्राञ्जलिराञ्जनेयम् ॥ ४॥  
 I bow with folded hands to Anjaneya who, having   
crossed the water of the ocean as if in play, took away   
the fire of grief consuming Sita and with that fire   
itself burnt down Lanka. 4.   
  
    मनोजवं मारुत-तुल्य-वेगं   
           जितेन्द्रियं बुद्धिमतां वरिष्ठम् ।  
    वातात्मजं वानर-यूथ-मुख्यं  
           श्रीराम-दूतं शिरसा नमामि ॥ ५॥  
 I bow with bent head to him who is quick of mind,  
fast as the wind, the conqueror of the sense organs, the   
best among the wise, the son of Vayu, chief of the   
monkey hordes, and the messenger of Shri Rama.  5.   
  
    आञ्जनेयमतिपाटलाननं  
           काञ्चनाद्रि-कमनीय-विग्रहम् ।  
    पारिजात-तरु-मूल-वासिनं  
           भावयामि पवमान-नन्दनम् ॥ ६॥  
 I meditate on the beloved son of Vayu, Anjaneya,   
with bright-red countenance and body attractive as a   
golden mountain, who lives under the Parijata tree. 6.   
  
    यत्र यत्र रघुनाथ-कीर्तनं  
           तत्र तत्र कृत-मस्तकाञ्जलिम् ।  
    बाष्प-वारि-परिपूर्ण-लोचनं  
           मारुतिर्नमत राक्षसान्तकम् ॥ ७॥  
 Bow to Hanuman, the slayer of the demons, who is   
present with folded hands raised to his head, his eyes   
brimming with tears of joy, whenever the name of  
Shri Rama is uttered with devotion.  7.
