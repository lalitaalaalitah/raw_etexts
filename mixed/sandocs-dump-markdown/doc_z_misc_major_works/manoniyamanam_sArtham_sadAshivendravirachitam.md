Harnessing the Mind  
(A minor work of Sri SadAshivendra Saraswati)  
  
Oh Mind! Enough of engaging in savouring  objects of enjoyment  
that are ephemeral just as the winking of the eyelids.  
The desire for objects is itself a poison. Engage henceforth in  
the contemplation of the Lord who is adorned with the shining  
moon crest on His head. 1  
  
Give up the notion of ᳚I᳚ in the most detestable body that  
is ever prone to troubles.  Having withdrawn the mind from the  
body identification, place it firmly in Brahman known as the  
compassionate Holy Feet of Lord Parama Shiva seated close at  
hand in your heart. 2  
  
The body is extremely fickle like a blade of grass.  Yet you  
look upon it as firm as a mountain and are deluded. Oh mind! You  
have thus turned away from the Holy Feet of Lord Shiva assailed  
by the decorative floral arrows of the temptations caused by  
Cupid. (The reference is here to the attempt made by Manmatha  
using the flower-arrows to tempt the meditating Lord Shiva. The  
Lord opened His third eye and this resulted in Manmatha being  
burnt to ashes on the spot. 3  
  
This day has been spent thus. ᳚The morrow shall bring me  
the Mount Sumeru (a fortune)᳚. Thus hoping daily, tell me  
O Mind! How many ᳚Sumeru-s᳚ have you gained so far? 4  
  
Oh My Heart! How many times have you experienced births/life  
as tree, grass and germs? Owing to some fortune you have now  
attained human birth and are endowed with farsightedness (this  
is the meaning that occurs to me for the word ᳚paara-spRg᳚  
in the verse.) Never be inadvertent in accomplishing the  
supreme good for yourself. 5  
  
As you are experiencing the results of your past actions, Oh  
My Mind! Why do you become dejected? Remember the infallible  
rule: A peepul seed planted will not yield mangoes.  Hence,  
give up dejection. 6  
  
Enough of sacrifices (yajnas), pilgrimages, renunciation and  
the company of the noble.  The most effective and easy means to  
emancipation is, Oh My Mind! The contemplation of Lord Shiva.  7  
  
Seeing the bewitching form in the glowing lamp that is a belle,  
Oh Mind-moth! Do not get deluded and fall into the form-fire  
and get destroyed. 8  
  
Oh Mind! The Great Doctor, Lord Shankara, the dispeller of  
the great samsaric delusion,  is ever to be sought out for  
refuge. Has not the Mother Shruti Herself named Him the  
᳚Foremost Divine Doctor᳚? 9  
  
Oh Mind ! Why do you help the fattening of the body by delicious  
food? The body indeed is the food vultures and dogs are waiting  
to eat up.  10  
  
Alas! When the Lord SAmbashiva, Who is easily pleased by the  
devout offering of even fruit, leaf, etc. is available so close  
at hand, how Oh my Mind! are you able to propitiate the lowly  
humans, difficult  to serve and please.  11  
  
From morning till night and from night to morning let the mind,  
giving up all other engagements, dwell in the Lotus Feet of  
the Lord Who is adorned with the crescent moon. 12  
  
Oh my friendly mind! Overpowered by the concern to satisfy the  
ever-unsatable stomach whom else are you serving ignoring the  
Blessed Lord adorned with the crescent moon on the head and  
Who is as white as camphor?   (the exact anvaya of the dhanya  
and tarunenduchoodam words are not clear; hence they are read  
along with the epithets of the Lord in the second line.) 13  
  
Here ends the work ᳚Manoniyamanam᳚ of Shri Sadashivendra Saraswati.
