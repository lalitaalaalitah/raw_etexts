A Necklace of Nine Gems  
(Composed by Sri SadAshivendra Saraswati)  
  
I have beheld the Holy Feet of the Acharya ShrI Paramashivendra  
Saraswati who is least interested in sense objects, who is the  
Lord of the Wealth of the Supremely Pure Knowledge and whose  
eyes are an ocean of immense compassion. 1  
  
I worship without tardiness, the Guru Shri Paramashivendra  
who has vanquished the lion called the opponent in debates,  
who has destroyed the king of foes namely pride, intoxication,  
lust, etc. and who is the moon to the bunch of lilies that  
are the people who surrender to him. 2  
  
I prostrate before the exalted Guru Shri Paramashivendra who is  
an adept in uplifting those who are immersed in the limitless  
ocean of samsara.  Verily the Guru is the Sun to the lotuses  
who are those taking refuge in Him. 3  
  
I have obtained a rare gem of Pure Knowledge from the ocean of  
compassion that is my Exalted Guru Shri Paramashivendra Acharya.  
I seek refuge in His Holy Feet within the inner quarters of  
my mind. 4  
  
I prostrate before my Guru Shri Paramashivendra upon whom  
Lord Paramashiva placed the load of inner speech and Himself  
embarked upon the Supreme Silence. (The reference is to Lord  
Dakshinamurti, the Silent Teacher, who inspires the Esoteric  
Knowledge within the mind of the seeker-disciple.) 5  
  
Even as the Guru Shri Paramashivendra is expounding the  
Scriptures, Ishwara, finding that He has become redundant,  
left to take abode under the Banyan Tree.  Such an exalted Guru  
I ever worship. (No misdemeanor is to be read into the words of  
the author; his devotion to his Guru licenses him to compare him  
with Ishwara and exemplifies the greatness of Guru Bhakti.) 6  
  
I salute Guru Shri Paramashivendra, the repository of all  
knowledge, an ocean of supreme compassion, who is equipped with  
the Realization that is capable of uplifting the ignorant who  
take refuge in Him. 7  
  
I think of Guru Shri Paramashivendra, whose inner darkness  
has vanished, who is a white lotus that has blossomed due to  
Self-knowledge and who is a pleasant moon on the firmament of  
bliss. 8  
  
I am never tired of worshipping Guru Shri Paramashivendra who  
teaches ᳚You are That Supreme Truth which is bereft of  
action, has no parts, is very subtle, which cannot be indicated  
and which is Pure ᳚. 9  
  
Whoever wears this necklace of nine gems which is in the form of  
a hymn on the Great Guru revels in the Kingdom of Liberation. 10  
  
Here ends the Hymn called ᳚Navamani maalaa᳚
