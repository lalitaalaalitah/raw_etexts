 सुदर्शनाष्टकम्   
  
by shrI V. Sadagopan  
October 2, 1995  
  
This year on Swami Desikan's birthday, I have translated the  
sudarshana Ashtakam at the request of a devotee of shrI  
Ranganatha Swami Sannadhi at Pomona, NY. This poem in  
melodious and lilting Sanskrit is a pleasure to recite and listen to.  
  
Traditionally, this stotram is recited in homes, when some one has  
fever or illness of other kinds. Swami Desikan is said to have composed  
it to help the residents of Tirupputkuzhi, when they suffered from the  
grip of a epidemic fever. Alternatively, It is said that he composed it  
at Tiruvahindrapuram prior to a major debate with a leader of another  
sampradaya. Swami Desikan won that debate and thereby established the  
supremacy of shrIman Narayana and Visishtadvaita.  
  
Swami Desikan chose the 'dhrithas' chandas as a meter for the eight  
verses praising sudarshana. He chose the 'aupachandasikam' meter  
for the phala-Sruti sloka. Both these meters hint at the  
Vedic origin of sudarshana as indicated by Swami Desikan in  
one or more verses of this Stotram.  
  
श्रीमते निगमान्त महादेशिकाय नमः  
  
श्रीमान् वेङ्कटनाथार्यः कवितार्किक केसरी ।  
वेदन्ताचार्य वर्यो मे सन्निधत्ताम् सदा हृदि ॥  
  
 Verse 1:   
प्रतिभटश्रेणि भीषण       वरगुणस्तोम भूषण  
जनिभयस्थान तारण          जगदवस्थान कारण ।  
निखिलदुष्कर्म कर्शन        निगमसद्धर्म दर्शन  
जय जय श्री सुदर्शन        जय जय श्री सुदर्शन ॥  
  
 O shrI sudarshana! All the enemies of your Lord's devotees run away fearing  
your prowess. All auspicious attributes find their home in you. Those ,  
Who worship you cross the 'shoreless' ocean of Samsara and free themselves  
from their cycles of births and deaths. The entire Universe is stabilized  
by your mighty power. You cut asunder all the sins of those who approach  
you as their refuge. You bless all of your devotees with the knowledge  
about the righteous conduct prescribed by the Vedas. O Lord sudarshana  
of these auspicious attributes! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!  
  
Verse 2:   
शुभजगद्रूप मण्डन        सुरगणत्रास खण्डन  
शतमखब्रह्म वन्दित         शतपथब्रह्म नन्दित   ।  
प्रथितविद्वत् सपक्षित       भजदहिर्बुध्न्य लक्षित  
जय जय श्री सुदर्शन       जय जय श्री सुदर्शन  ॥  
  
 O shrI sudarshana! You are resplendent as a precious decoration on the  
hand of shrIman Narayana, who has the universes as His body. Through  
your grace, Devas are freed from the fear caused by the Asuras. Indra  
and Brahma always worship you. The Satapatha Brahmana belonging to  
Sukla Yajur Veda hails your glories and pays its tributes to you. The  
scholars of this universe seek your help to overcome their contestants.  
Ahirbudhnya Samhita states that Ahirbudhnya (Siva) worships you and  
sought the boon to see your beautiful form with His own eyes. O Lord  
sudarshana of illustrious attributes! Hail To Thee! Hail to Thee!  
  
Verse 3:   
स्फुटतटिज्जाल पिञ्जर     पृथुतरज्वाल पञ्जर  
परिगत प्रत्नविग्रह        पतुतरप्रज्ञ दुर्ग्रह  ।  
प्रहरण ग्राम मण्डित      परिजन त्राण पण्डित  
जय जय श्री सुदर्शन जय जय श्री सुदर्शन  ॥  
  
 O Lord sudarshana! You shine like the resplendent assembly of  
lightnings. The bright tongues of flames surrounding you appear  
like a cage (home) for you. The forms of Vasudeva, Sankarshana  
and other vyuha murti-s find their positions around your  
geometric form (yantra). Even the scholars with sharp intellects stumble,  
when they try to understand the full extent of your glory. It is a  
beautiful sight to see the sixteen weapons of yours resting on your hands  
to serve you. You are dedicated to come to the rescue of those ,who seek  
your protection . O shrI sudarshana of such auspicious attributes! Hail  
to Thee! Hail to Thee!  
  
Verse  4:   
निजपदप्रीत सद्गण निरुपधिस्फीत षड्गुण  
निगम निर्व्यूढ वैभव       निजपर व्यूह वैभव  ।  
हरि हय द्वेषि दारण      हर पुर प्लोष कारण  
जय जय श्री सुदर्शन       जय जय श्री सुदर्शन  ॥  
  
 O Lord sudarshana! The Righteous people have firm attachment to  
your holy feet. The Six Kalyana GunAs --- Knowledge, Power, Strength,  
Wealth, Heroism, and effulgence-- find their natural home in You. The  
Vedas have firmly established Your glory in their many chapters. Like  
your Lord, You have the forms of para and vyuha. You cut asunder the fear  
caused by the foes of Indra, the foremost among your devotees. You were  
responsible for the burning down Kashi, the city of Siva to ashes. You  
stood at the tip of Siva's arrow, when He was engaged in the campaign  
to destroy TripurAsura. O shrI sudarshana Of such Kalyana Gunas! Hail  
to Thee! Hail to Thee!  
  
Verse 5:   
दनुज विस्तार कर्तन जनि तमिस्रा विकर्तन  
दनुजविद्या निकर्तन          भजदविद्या निवर्तन ।  
अमर दृष्ट स्व विक्रम       समर जुष्ट भ्रमिक्रम  
जय जय श्री सुदर्शन      जय जय श्री सुदर्शन  ॥  
  
 O Lord sudarshana! You arrest the growth of the evil-minded Asuras  
and destroy them down to their roots. You are like the resplendent Sun  
banishing the dark night of Samsara, which bedevil your devotees. You  
Overcome any and every act of deception practised by the Asuras. You  
remove every shred of false knowledge that invade the minds of those ,who  
seek refuge in you. The Devas celebrate Your heroic deeds and experience  
joy in witnessing Your powerful actions. You revolve and rotate in many  
ways in your battles against the enemies of Your devotees. May Thou with  
such auspicious attributes prosper further! Hail to Thee! Hail To Thee!  
  
Verse 6:   
प्रथिमुखालीढ बन्धुर       पृथुमहाहेति दन्तुर  
विकटमाय बहिष्कृत        विविधमाला  परिष्कृत ।  
स्थिरमहायन्त्र तन्त्रित        दृढ दया तन्त्र यन्त्रित  
जय जय श्री सुदर्शन         जय जय श्री सुदर्शन  ॥  
  
 O Lord sudarshana! You give darsana to us with Your dynamic gait of One  
foot placed forward in movement and the other rapidly following it. Your  
position in that gait is beautiful to behold. You are surrounded by Your  
magnificient and fearsome weapons. You are the conqueror of Powerful  
illusions (mAyA) caused by Asuras. You are not therefore affected  
by their acts of MayA. You are decorated with many beautiful flower  
garlands that add to your natural beauty. You are firmly bound in the  
warp of your great compassion for your devotees and bless them , when  
they worship You through Your Yantra and Mantra. O shrI sudarshana of  
such auspicious qualities! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!  
  
Verse 7:   
महित सम्पत् सदक्षर     विहितसम्पत् षडक्षर  
षडरचक्र प्रतिष्ठित    सकल तत्त्व प्रतिष्ठित ।  
विविध सङ्कल्प कल्पक     विबुधसङ्कल्प कल्पक  
जय जय श्री सुदर्शन जय जय श्री सुदर्शन  ॥  
  
 O Lord sudarshana of many prime qualities! The wealth of the  
righteous is their true knowledge about Your Lord. You Bless  
them with the unperishable wealth of MokSham, When they seek  
refuge at Your holy feet. Those who recite Your mantra made up  
of the six letters (akSharas) gain incomparable wealth. Your devotees  
(upAsakas) invoke You in Your yantra of six corners formed by two  
intersecting triangles and worship You at its epicenter. You pervade and  
reside in all the creations of Your Lord. You have the power to complete  
all deeds that you decide to undertake. You are thus a satya sankalpa and  
serve as the divine Kalpaka tree granting all the boons that your devotees  
request. O shrI sudarshana! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!  
  
Verse 8:   
भुवन नेत्र त्रयीमय      सवन तेजस्त्रयीमय  
निरवधि स्वादु चिन्मय    निखिल शक्ते जगन्मय  ।  
अमित विश्वक्रियामय शमित विश्वग्भयामय  
जय जय श्री सुदर्शन      जय जय  श्री सुदर्शन  ॥  
  
 O Lord sudarshana, the eye of the Universe! You are of the  
form of the three Vedas. You are of the form of the three fires  
-- gArhapatyam, Ahvaneeyam and dakShinAgni -- of the  
YagAs. You are of the delectable form of true knowledge! You have the  
power to accomplish every deed. You have taken the form of the Universe  
and its contents. You are woorshipped thru the sacrificial rituals of  
your devotees. In return, You destroy the fears and diseases of those,  
who worship You from all directions. O Lord sudarshana of auspicious  
qualities! Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee!  
  
Verse 9:   
फल श्रुति  
  
द्विचतुष्कमिदं प्रभूतसारं पठतां वेङ्कटनायक प्रणीतम् ।  
विषमेऽपि मनोरथः प्रधावन् न विहन्येत रथाङ्ग धुर्य गुप्तः  ॥

verses in praise of sudarshana composed by Venkatanatha known as Vedanta  
Desikan comprehend the deep references to the glory of Lord sudarshana  
will have the fulfilment of all their wishes.The Boon-granting powers of  
Lord sudarshana will make them realize all their wishes by overcoming all  
obstacles that stand in the way.

कवितार्किकसिंहाय कल्याणगुणशालिने ।
