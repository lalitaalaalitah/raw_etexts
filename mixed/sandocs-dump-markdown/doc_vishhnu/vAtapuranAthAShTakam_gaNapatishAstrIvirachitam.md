 श्रीवातपुरनाथाष्टकम्   
  
कुन्दसुमवृन्दसममन्दहसितास्यं  
     नन्दकुलनन्दभरतुन्दलनकन्दम् ।  
पूतनिजगीतलवधूतदुरितं तं  
     वातपुरनाथमिममातनु हृदब्जे ॥ १॥  
  
1. Lodge in the lotus of your heart the Lord of Guruvayur  
whose face wears a gentle smile that resembles a bunch of  
jasmine flowers, who is the cause of the happiness of the  
house of Nandagopa, and who removes the sufferings of  
devotees who chant even a little bit of the accounts of His  
sacred life.  
  
नीलतरजालधरभालहरिरम्यं  
     लोलतरशीलयुतबालजनलीलम् ।  
जालनतिशीलमपि पालयितुकामं  
     वातपुरनाथमिममातनु हृदब्जे ॥ २॥  
  
2. Lodge in the lotus of your heart the Lord of Guruvayur  
whose divine splendour is like that of a dark rainbearing  
cloud, who enjoys the company of children who indulge in  
childish pranks, and who is eager to protect even those who  
bow before Him with evil intention.  
  
कंसरणहिंसमिह संसरणजात-  
     क्लान्तिभरशान्तिकरकान्तिझरवीतम् ।  
वातमुखधातुजनिपातभयघातं  
     वातपुरनाथमिममातनु हृदब्जे ॥ ३॥  
  
3. Lodge in the lotus of your heart the Lord of Guruvayur who  
killed Kamsa in a fight, whose flow of compassion removes all  
the sufferings of worldly existence and bestows peace of mind,  
and who eradicates the fear of diseases such as arthritis  
caused by the imbalance of body fluids.  
  
जातुधुरिपातुकमिहातुरजनं द्राक्  
     शोकभरमूकमपि तोकमिव पान्तम् ।  
भृङ्गरुचिसङ्गरकृदङ्गलतिकं तं  
     वातपुरनाथमिममातनु हृदब्जे ॥ ४॥  
  
4. Lodge in the lotus of your heart the Lord of Guruvayur who  
hastens to protect devotees who make offerings to Him for the  
eradication of sufferings, who protects those who are  
overwhelmed by grief, as one protects a child, and the  
splendour of whose body defeats that of the black bee.  
  
पापभवतापभरकोपशमनार्था-  
     श्वासकरभासमृदुहासरुचिरास्यम् ।  
रोगचयभोगभयवेगहरमेकं  
     वातपुरनाथमिममातनु हृदब्जे ॥ ५॥  
  
5. Lodge in the lotus of your heart the Lord of Guruvayur  
whose face shines with a charming smile which removes the  
suffering and anger caused by past sins and gives devotees  
mental solace, and who removes the fear in their minds that  
they may suffer from various diseases.  
  
घोषकुलदोषहरवेषमुपयान्तं  
     पूषशतदूषकविभूषणगणाढ्यम् ।  
भुक्तिमपिमुक्तिमतिभक्तिषु ददानं  
     वातपुरनाथमिममातनु हृदब्जे ॥ ६॥  
  
6. Lodge in the lotus of your heart the Lord of Guruvayur who  
assumed the form of a shepherd boy to remove all evils, who  
shines with ornaments which beat the brilliance of hundreds  
of suns, and who confers worldly enjoyments as well as  
liberation on those who have intense devotion.  
  
पापकदुरापमतितापहरशोभ-  
     स्वापघनमामतदुमापतिसमेतम् ।  
दूनतरदीनसुखदानकृतदीक्षं  
     वातपुरनाथमिममातनु हृदब्जे ॥ ७॥  
  
7. Lodge in the lotus of your heart the Lord of Guruvayur who  
cannot be attained by sinners, who removes suffering just as  
the rainbearing cloud removes heat (by pouring down rain),  
who is by the side of Lord Parameswara, and who is eager to  
bestow happiness on those who are undergoing acute mental  
agony.  
  
पादपतदादरणमोदपरिपूर्णं  
जीवमुखदेवजनसेवनफलाङ्घ्रिम्  
रूक्षभवमोक्षकृतदीक्षनिजवीक्षं  
     वातपुरनाथमिममातनु हृदब्जे ॥ ८॥  
  
8. Lodge in the lotus of your heart the Lord of Guruvayur who  
is happy to shower His grace on those who worship Him,  
whose feet confer blessings on all creatures including the  
gods, and who is eager to bestow liberation from cruel  
transmigratory existence.  
  
भृत्यगणपत्युदितनुत्युचितमोदं  
     स्पष्टमिदमष्टकमदुष्टकरणार्हम् ।  
आदधतमादरदमादिलयशून्यं  
     वातपुरनाथमिममातनु हृदब्जे ॥ ९॥  
  
9. Lodge in the lotus of your heart the Lord of Guruvayur who  
is pleased with this hymn of eight stanzas composed by  
devotee Ganapati which confers happiness, who bestows His  
grace on all and who has no beginning or end.  
  
इति महामहोपाध्याय ब्रह्मश्री गणपतीशास्त्रीविरचितं  
श्रीवातपुरनाथाष्टकम् ॥  
  
  
This hymn was composed by Mahaamahopaadhyaaya  
Brahmasri Ganapathi Sastrigal, a disciple of the great devotee  
scholar Mannargudi Brahmasri Raju Sastrigal, when he was  
worshipping the Lord at the Guruvayur temple.
