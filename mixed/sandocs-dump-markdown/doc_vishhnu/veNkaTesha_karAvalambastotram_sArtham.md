Hymn to Shri Venkatesha for the support of his hand  
Translation by A. Narayanaswami   
     श्री शेषशैल सुनिकेतन दिव्यमूर्ते  
        नारायणाच्युत हरे नलिनायताक्ष ।  
     लीलाकटाक्ष परिरक्षित सर्वलोक  
        श्री वेङ्कटेश मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ १॥  
 O Shri Venkatesha, you who have your magnificent  
abode on the Shesha Hills, you of the divine form,  
Narayana, Achyuta, Hari, with eyes broad as  
lotus petals, you who protect all the worlds  
with a playful sidelong glance of your eyes,  
give me the support of your hand. 1.   
     ब्रह्मादिवन्दितपदाम्बुज शङ्खपाणे  
        श्रीमत्सुदर्शन सुशोभित दिव्यहस्त ।  
     कारुण्यसागर शरण्य सुपुण्यमूर्ते  
        श्री वेङ्कटेश मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ २॥  
 O Shri Venkatesha, whose lotus-like feet  
Brahma and other gods worship, you with the  
conch in your hand, whose divine hand is well  
adorned with the Sudarshana discus, you ocean of  
mercy, the refuge of all, embodiment of purity,  
give me the support of your hand. 2.   
     वेदान्त-वेद्य भवसागर-कर्णधार  
        श्रीपद्मनाभ कमलार्चितपादपद्म ।  
     लोकैक-पावन परात्पर पापहारिन्  
        श्री वेङ्कटेश मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ ३॥  
 O Shri Venkatesha, who are to be comprehended  
from the Upanishads, who are the pilot for all to  
cross the ocean of worldly life, O Shri Padmanabha  
whose lotus-like feet Laxmi worships, who alone  
make the world a holy place, O you Vishnu who  
remove all sins, give me the support of your hand. 3.   
     लक्ष्मीपते निगमलक्ष्य निजस्वरूप  
        कामादिदोष परिहारक बोधदायिन् ।  
     दैत्यादिमर्दन जनार्दन वासुदेव  
        श्री वेङ्कटेश मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ ४॥  
 O Shri Venkatesha, husband of Laxmi, whose innate  
nature is the theme of the Vedas, you who impart  
self-realization that takes away lust and other evils,  
who put down the Asuras and others of ill intent,  
O Janardana, Vasudeva, give me the support of your hand. 4.   
     तापत्रयं हर विभो रभसा मुरारे  
        संरक्ष मां करुणया सरसीरुहाक्ष ।  
     मच्छिष्यमित्यनुदिनं परिरक्ष विष्णो  
        श्री वेङ्कटेश मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ ५॥  
 O Shri Venkatesha, rid me fast of the three  
miseries (of spiritual, material, and supernatural  
origin) that afflict man, all-powerful Murare, in  
your compassion, you with eyes like the lotus,  
protect me; and, O Vishnu, considering me your  
disciple, protect me every day; and give me  
the support of your hand. 5.   
     श्री जातरूपनवरत्न लसत्किरीट-  
        कस्तूरिकातिलकशोभिललाटदेश ।  
     राकेन्दुबिम्ब वदनाम्बुज वारिजाक्ष  
        श्री वेङ्कटेश मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ ६॥  
 O Shri Venkatesha, with the golden crown  
glittering with the nine kinds of gems, with  
your forehead adorned with the marking done  
with the musk, you with the lotus-like face  
resembling the moon at the full and eyes  
like the lotus, give me the support of your hand. 6.   
     वन्दारुलोक-वरदान-वचोविलास  
           रत्नाढ्यहार परिशोभित कम्बुकण्ठ ।  
     केयूररत्न सुविभासि-दिगन्तराल  
           श्री वेङ्कटेश मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ ७॥  
 O Shri Venkatesha, whose gracious words bestow  
the boons sought by the crowd praising your glories,  
whose conch-like neck is adorned with a necklace  
studded with precious stones, the bright gems on  
whose shoulder ornament illumine the horizons of  
the compass, give me the support of your hand. 7.   
     दिव्याङ्गदाङ्कित भुजद्वय मङ्गलात्मन्  
        केयूरभूषण सुशोभित दीर्घबाहो ।  
     नागेन्द्र-कङ्कण करद्वय कामदायिन्  
        श्री वेङ्कटेश मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ ८॥  
 O Shri Venkatesha, you who have your upper  
arms bedecked with bracelets, who are the spirit of  
auspiciousness, who are adorned with shoulder ornaments,  
who have the lords of the serpents for wristbands on  
both your hands, who give (your devotees) all they  
desire, give me the support of your hand. 8.   
     स्वामिन् जगद्धरणवारिधिमध्यमग्न  
        मामुद्धारय कृपया करुणापयोधे ।  
     लक्ष्मींश्च देहि मम धर्म समृद्धिहेतुं  
        श्री वेङ्कटेश मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ ९॥  
 O Shri Venkatesha, Lord, who support the  
universe, ocean of compassion, I  
pray, in your mercy, lift me up who am sunk in  
the middle of the sea (of mundane pursuits);  
also bestow on me the auspicious outlook which  
is the basis for the accumulation of spiritual  
merit, and give me the support of your hand. 9.   
     दिव्याङ्गरागपरिचर्चित कोमलाङ्ग  
        पीताम्बरावृततनो तरुणार्क भास  
     सत्याञ्च नाभ परिधान सुपत्तु बन्ध  
        श्री वेङ्कटेश मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ १०॥  
 O Shri Venkatesha, whose handsome body is smeared  
with a heavenly (coloring) powder and is covered with  
a yellow cloth, whose brightness is like that of the  
morning sun, who have Brahma (the Creator) in your navel,  
and whose waist is tied with a cloth, give me the  
support of your hand. 10.   
     रत्नाढ्यदाम सुनिबद्ध-कटि-प्रदेश  
        माणिक्यदर्पण सुसन्निभ जानुदेश ।  
     जङ्घाद्वयेन परिमोहित सर्वलोक  
        श्री वेङ्कटेश मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ ११॥  
 O Shri Venkatesha, who have your waist well-secured  
with a band studded with gems, whose knees resemble mirrors  
wrought of the ruby, who captivate the entire world by (the  
beauty of) your feet, give me the support of your hand. 12.   
     लोकैकपावन-सरित्परिशोभिताङ्घ्रे  
        त्वत्पाददर्शन दिने च ममाघमीश ।  
     हार्दं तमश्च सकलं लयमाप भूमन्  
        श्री वेङ्कटेश मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ १२॥  
 O Shri Venkatesha, whose feet are lustrous with  
the river (Ganga) that purifies the universe, the  
day I had sight of your feet, my sins and the  
(spiritual) darkness in my heart were all  
dissolved away, O sovereign Lord; give me the  
support of your hand. 12.   
     कामादि-वैरि-निवहोच्युत मे प्रयातः  
        दारिद्र्यमप्यपगतं सकलं दयालो ।  
     दीनं च मां समवलोक्य दयार्द्र दृष्ट्या  
        श्री वेङ्कटेश मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ १३॥  
 O Shri Venkatesha, when you looked me over  
while I was in distress, with eyes full of  
compassion, all the enemies (to spiritual progress),  
lust, and other evil passions departed from me,  
and, merciful One, all my poverty vanished; give  
me the support of your hand. 13.   
     श्री वेङ्कटेश पदपङ्कज षट्पदेन  
        श्रीमन्नृसिंहयतिना रचितं जगत्याम् ।  
     ये तत्पठन्ति मनुजाः पुरुषोत्तमस्य  
        ते प्राप्नुवन्ति परमां पदवीं मुरारेः ॥ १४॥  
 These verses were composed by the sannyasin Shriman  
Nrisinha, who was like a honey-bee hovering over the lotus  
feet of Shri Venkatesha. Those mortals who recite them  
will attain to the supreme world of Visnu. 14.   
॥ इति श्री शृङ्गेरि जगद्गुरुणा श्री नृसिंह भारति  
स्वामिना रचितं श्री वेङ्कटेश करावलम्ब स्तोत्रं सम्पूर्णम् ॥  
 Thus is complete the Shri Venkatesha  
Karavalamba Stotram composed by Shri  
Nrisinha Bharati Svami, the Jagadguru of Srngeri.  
  
  
  
 Note: Among the 36 Jagadgurus, starting with Adi Shankaracharya,  
who have adorned the Shringeri Muth since it was  
founded twelve centuries ago, eight have had the name  
Nrisinha (Narasinha) Bharati.  We do not know which  
of the eight is the author of this beautiful hymn.
