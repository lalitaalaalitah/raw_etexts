 बिभीषणगीता अथवा धर्मरथगीतं रामचरितमानस से   
  
रावनु रथी बिरथ रघुबीरा । देखि बिभीषन भयउ अधीरा ।  
अधिक प्रीति मन भा सन्देहा । बन्दि चरन कह सहित सनेहा । १ ।  
नाथ न रथ नहिं तन पद त्रानां । केहि बिधि जितब बीर बलवाना ।  
सुनहु सखा कह कृपानिधाना । जेहिं जय होइ सो स्यन्दन आना । २ ।  
सौरज धीरज तेहि रथ चाका । सत्य सील दृढ़ ध्वजा पताका ।  
बल बिबेक दम परहित घोरे । छमा कृपा समता रजु जोरे । ३ ।  
ईस भजनु सारथी सुजाना । बिरति चर्म सन्तोष कृपाना ।  
दान परसु बुधि सक्ति प्रचण्डा । बर बिग्यान कठिन कोदण्डा । ४ ।  
अमल अचल मन त्रोन समाना । सम जम नियम सिलीमुख नाना ।  
कवच अभेद बिप्र गुर पूजा । एहि सम बिजय उपाय न दूजा । ५ ।  
सखा धर्ममय अस रथ जाकें । जीतन कहँ न कतहुँ रिपु ताकें । ६ ।  
  
VibhiShana was disconcerted when he saw Ravana mounted on a chariot and the Hero  
of Raghu's line without any. His great fondness for the Lord filled his mind  
with diffidence; and bowing to His feet he spoke with a tender heart: 'My lord,  
You have no chariot nor any protection either for Your body (in the shape of  
armour) or for Your feet (in the shape of shoes). How, then, can You expect to  
conquer this mighty hero?' `Listen, friend:' replied the All-merciful, 'the  
chariot which leads one to victory is quite another. Valour and fortitude are  
the wheels of that chariot, while truthfulness and good conduct are its enduring  
banner and standard. Even so strength, discretion, self-control and benevolence  
are its four horses, that have been joined to the chariot with the cords of  
forgiveness, compassion and evenness of mind. Adoration of God is the expert  
driver; dispassion, the shield and contentment, the sword. Again, charity is the  
axe; reason, the fierce lance and the highest wisdom, the relentless bow. A pure  
and steady mind is like a quiver; while quietude and the various forms of  
abstinence (Yamas) and religious observances (niyamas) are a sheaf of arrows.  
Homage to the Brahmanas and to one's own preceptor is an impenetrable coat of  
mail; there is no other equipment for victory as efficacious as this. My friend,  
he who owns such a chariot of piety shall have no enemy to conquer anywhere.'  
(1-6)  
  
  
दोहा  
महा अजय संसार रिपु जीति सकइ सो बीर ।  
जाकें अस रथ होइ दृढ़ सुनहु सखा मतिधीर । ८० (क) ।  
सुनि प्रभु बचन बिभीषन हरषि गहे पद कञ्ज ।  
एहि मिस मोहि उपदेसेहु राम कृपा सुख पुञ्ज । ८० (ख) ।  
  
`Listen, O friend of resolute mind: the hero who happens to be in possession of  
such a strong chariot can conquer even that mighty and invincible foe,  
attachment to the world.' Hearing the Lord's words, Vibhishana clasped His lotus  
feet in joy. `You have utilized this opportunity to exhort me, O Rama, an  
embodiment of grace and bliss that You are.' (80 A-B)
