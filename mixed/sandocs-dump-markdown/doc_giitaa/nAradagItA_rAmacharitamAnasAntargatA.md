 नारदगीता रामचरितमानससे   
  
चौपाई  
  
देखि राम अति रुचिर तलावा । मज्जनु कीन्ह परम सुख पावा ।  
देखी सुन्दर तरुबर छाया । बैठे अनुज सहित रघुराया । १ ।  
तहँ पुनि सकल देव मुनि आए । अस्तुति करि निज धाम सिधाए ।  
बैठे परम प्रसन्न कृपाला । कहत अनुज सन कथा रसाला । २ ।  
बिरहवन्त भगवन्तहि देखी । नारद मन भा सोच बिसेषी ।  
मोर साप करि अङ्गीकारा । सहत राम नाना दुख भारा । ३ ।  
ऐसे प्रभुहि बिलोकउँ जाई । पुनि न बनिहि अस अवसरु आई ।  
यह बिचारि नारद कर बीना । गए जहाँ प्रभु सुख आसीना । ४ ।  
गावत राम चरित मृदु बानी । प्रेम सहित बहु भाति बखानी ।  
करत दण्डवत लिए उठाई । राखे बहुत बार उर लाई । ५ ।  
स्वागत पूँछि निकट बैठारे । लछिमन सादर चरन पखारे । ६ ।  
  
  
When Shri Rama saw this most beautiful lake, He took a dip into it and felt  
supremely delighted. Seeing the pleasant shade of a stately tree, the Lord of  
Raghus sat in it with His younger brother. There all the gods and sages came  
once more and having hymned His praises returned to their several homes. The  
All-merciful sat in a most cheerful mood and discoursed with His younger brother  
on delightful topics. When the sage Narada saw the Lord suffering the pangs of  
separation, he felt much perturbed at heart. ' It is in submission to my curse*  
that the Lord is undergoing many hardships of an oppressive nature. Let me,  
therefore, go and see such a noble Lord; for such an opportunity may not present  
itself again,' Reflecting thus Narada went, lute in hand, to the spot where the  
Lord was sitting at ease. He fondly sang in a soft voice the exploits of Shri  
Rama dwelling upon them in all detail. As he prostrated himself the Lord lifted  
him up and held him in His embrace for a long time. After enquiring of his  
welfare He seated him by His side, while LakShmana reverently laved His feet.

coming after it.  
  
दोहा  
  
नाना बिधि बिनती करि प्रभु प्रसन्न जियँ जानि ।  
नारद बोले बचन तब जोरि सरोरुह पानि । ४१ ।  
  
  
After much supplication and realizing that the Lord was pleased at heart,  
Narada joined his lotus palms and spoke as follows:- (41)  
  
चौपाई  
  
सुनहु उदार सहज रघुनायक । सुन्दर अगम सुगम बर दायक ।  
देहु एक बर मागउँ स्वामी । जद्यपि जानत अन्तरजामी । १ ।  
जानहु मुनि तुम्ह मोर सुभाऊ । जन सन कबहुँ कि करउँ दुराऊ ।  
कवन बस्तु असि प्रिय मोहि लागी । जो मुनिबर न सकहु तुम्ह मागी । २ ।  
जन कहुँ कछु अदेय नहिं मोरें । अस बिस्वास तजहु जनि भोरें ।  
तब नारद बोले हरषाई । अस बर मागउँ करउँ ढिठाई । ३ ।  
जद्यपि प्रभु के नाम अनेका । श्रुति कह अधिक एक तें एका ।  
राम सकल नामन्ह तें अधिका । होउ नाथ अघ खग गन बधिका । ४ ।  
  
  
` Listen, O Lord of Raghus, generous by nature as You are: You confer  
delightful boons that are unattainable as well as those that are attainable.  
Grant me, my master, only one boon that I ask of You, even though You already  
know it (even without my asking), indwelling as You do the hearts of all.' '  
You know my disposition, dear sage: do I ever hide anything from my devotees ?  
What object do I hold so dear, O chief of sages, that you may not ask it of Me  
? There is nothing which I may withhold from my votary: never give up this  
belief even by mistake.' Then Narada gladly said, 'This is the boon I presume  
to ask: even though my lord has many names, each greater than the other, as  
the Vedas declare, let the name RaMA, my lord, surpass all other names in  
exterminating the whole brood of sins even as a fowler kills an entire flock  
of birds. (1-4)  
  
दोहा  
  
राका रजनी भगति तव राम नाम सोइ सोम ।  
अपर नाम उडगन बिमल बसहुँ भगत उर ब्योम । ४२ (क) ।  
एवमस्तु मुनि सन कहेउ कृपासिन्धु रघुनाथ ।  
तब नारद मन हरष अति प्रभु पद नायउ माथ । ४२ (ख) ।  
  
  
` May the name RaMA shine as the moon and the other names as so many stars in  
the cloudless sky of Your devotee's heart during the full-moon night of  
devotion to You.' 'The all-merciful Lord of Raghus replied to the sage, 'So be  
it ' Thereupon Narada felt much delighted at heart and bowed at the Lord's  
feet. (42 A-B)  
  
चौपाई  
  
अति प्रसन्न रघुनाथहि जानी । पुनि नारद बोले मृदु बानी ।  
राम जबहिं प्रेरेउ निज माया । मोहेहु मोहि सुनहु रघुराया । १ ।  
तब बिबाह मैं चाहौँ कीन्हा । प्रभु केहि कारन करै न दीन्हा ।  
सुनु मुनि तोहि कहउँ सहरोसा । भजहिं जे मोहि तजि सकल भरोसा । २ ।  
करउँ सदा तिन्ह कै रखवारी । जिमि बालक राखइ महतारी ।  
गह सिसु बच्छ अनल अहि धाई । तहँ राखइ जननी अरगाई । ३ ।  
प्रौढ़ भएँ तेहि सुत पर माता । प्रीति करइ नहिं पाछिलि बाता ।  
मोरें प्रौढ़ तनय सम ग्यानी । बालक सुत सम दास अमानी । ४ ।  
जनहि मोर बल निज बल ताही । दुहु कहं काम क्रोध रिपु आही ।  
यह बिचारि पण्डित मोहि भजहीं । पाएहुँ ग्यान भगति नहिं तजहीं । ५ ।  
  
  
Seeing the Lord of Raghus so highly pleased, Narada spoke again in gentle  
tones- ' Listen, O Rama: when You impelled Your Maya (deluding potency) and  
infatuated me, O Lord of Raghus, I wanted to marry. Why, then, did You not let  
me accomplish my desire ?' ' Listen, O sage: I tell you with all the emphasis  
at My command that I always take care of those who worship Me with undivided  
faith, even as a mother guards her child. If an infant child runs to catch  
hold of fire or a snake, the mother holds it aside. When, however, her son has  
grown up she loves him no doubt, but not as before. The wise are like My grown  
up sons, while humble devotees are like My infant children. A devotee depends  
on Me, while the former ( a wise man) depends on his own strength; and both  
have to face enemies like lust and anger. Pondering thus the prudent adore Me  
and never take leave of devotion even after attaining wisdom. (1-5)  
  
दोहा  
  
काम क्रोध लोभादि मद प्रबल मोह कै धारि ।  
तिन्ह महँ अति दारुन दुखद मायारूपी नारि । ४३ ।  
  
  
`Lust, anger, greed, pride etc., constitute the most powerful army of  
Ignorance. But among them all the fiercest and the most troublesome is that  
incarnation of Maya (the Lord's deluding potency) called woman.' (43)  
  
चौपाई  
  
सुनु मुनि कह पुरान श्रुति सन्ता । मोह बिपिन कहुँ नारि बसन्ता ।  
जप तप नेम जलाश्रय झारी । होइ ग्रीषम सोषै सब नारी । १ ।  
काम क्रोध मद मत्सर भेका । इन्हहि हरषप्रद बरषा एका ।  
दुर्बासना कुमुद समुदाई । तिन्ह कहँ सरद सदा सुखदाई । २ ।  
धर्म सकल सरसीरुह बृन्दा । होइ हिम तिन्हहि दहै सुख मन्दा ।  
पुनि ममता जवास बहुताई । पलुहइ नारि सिसिर रितु पाई । ३ ।  
पाप उलूक निकर सुखकारी । नारि निबिड़ रजनी अँधिआरी ।  
बुधि बल सील सत्य सब मीना । बनसी सम त्रिय कहहिं प्रबीना । ४ ।  
  
`Listen, O sage: the Puranas, the Vedas and the saints declare that woman is  
like the vernal season to the forest of ignorance. Nay, like the hot season  
she dries up all the ponds and lakes of Japa (the muttering of prayers),  
austerity and religious observances. Again, lust, anger, pride and jealousy  
are so many frogs as it were; like the rainy season woman is the only agency  
that gladdens them all. Even so latent desires of a vicious type are like a  
bed of lilies, to which, like the autumn, she is ever agreeable. All the  
different virtues are like a bed of lotuses; like the middle of winter, woman,  
who is a source of base (sensuous) pleasure, blights them all. Again, the  
overgrowth of the Yavasa plant in the shape of mineness flourishes when the  
close of winter in the shape of woman appears. For owls in the shape of sins  
woman is a delightful night thick with darkness. Even so reason, strength,  
virtue and truth are all so many fishes as it were; and woman, so declare the  
wise, is like a hook to catch them.' (1-4)  
  
दोहा  
  
अवगुन मूल सूलप्रद प्रमदा सब दुख खानि ।  
ताते कीन्ह निवारन मुनि मैं यह जियँ जानि । ४४ ।  
  
  
`A young woman is the root of all evil, a source of torment and a mine of all  
woes. Therefore, bearing this in mind, O sage, I prevented your marriage.'  
(44)  
  
चौपाई  
  
सुनि रघुपति के बचन सुहाए । मुनि तन पुलक नयन भरि आए ।  
कहहु कवन प्रभु कै असि रीती । सेवक पर ममता अरु प्रीती । १ ।  
जे न भजहिं अस प्रभु भ्रम त्यागी । ग्यान रङ्क नर मन्द अभागी ।  
पुनि सादर बोले मुनि नारद । सुनहु राम बिग्यान बिसारद । २ ।  
सन्तन्ह के लच्छन रघुबीरा । कहहु नाथ भव भञ्जन भीरा ।  
सुनु मुनि सन्तन्ह के गुन कहऊँ । जिन्ह ते मैं उन्ह कें बस रहऊँ । ३ ।  
षट बिकार जित अनघ अकामा । अचल अकिञ्चन सुचि सुखधामा ।  
अमितबोध अनीह मितभोगी । सत्यसार कबि कोबिद जोगी । ४ ।  
सावधान मानद मदहीना । धीर धर्म गति परम प्रबीना । ५ ।  
  
  
As the sage listened to the delightful words of Shri Rama (the Lord of Raghus),  
a thrill ran through his body and his eyes filled with tears. He said to  
himself, 'Tell me, is there any other master whose wont it is to show such  
attachment and fondness for his servantsi Men who refuse to worship such a  
lord shaking off all delusion are bankrupt of wisdom, dull-writted and  
wretched.'  
  
The sage Narada again reverentially spoke to the Lord, ' Listen, O Rama, who  
are well-versed in sacred lore: tell me, my lord Raghuvira (Hero of Raghu's  
line), the distinguishing marks of saints, O dispeller of the fear of  
transmigration.' ' I tell you, dear sage, the qualities of saints, by virtue  
of which they hold Me in subjection. They are masters of the six passions  
(lust, anger, greed, infatuation, pride and jealousy), sinless, disinterested,  
firm, possessing nothing, pure (both within and without), full of bliss, of  
boundless wisdom, desireless, moderate in diet, truthful, inspired, learned  
and united with God, circumspect, bestowing honour on others, free from pride,  
strong-minded and highly conversant with the course of Dharma (righteousness).  
(1-5)  
  
दोहा  
  
गुनागार संसार दुख रहित बिगत सन्देह ।  
तजि मम चरन सरोज प्रिय तिन्ह कहुँ देह न गेह । ४५ ।  
  
  
`They are abodes of virtue, above the sorrows of the world and free from  
doubt. Nothing besides My lotus feet is dear to them, not even their body nor  
their home.' (45)  
  
चौपाई  
  
निज गुन श्रवन सुनत सकुचाहीं । पर गुन सुनत अधिक हरषाहीं ।  
सम सीतल नहिं त्यागहिं नीती । सरल सुभाउ सबहि सन प्रीती । १ ।  
जप तप ब्रत दम सञ्जम नेमा । गुरु गोबिन्द बिप्र पद प्रेमा ।  
श्रद्धा छमा मयत्री दाया । मुदिता मम पद प्रीति अमाया । २ ।  
बिरति बिबेक बिनय बिग्याना । बोध जथारथ बेद पुराना ।  
दम्भ मान मद करहिं न काऊ । भूलि न देहिं कुमारग पाऊ । ३ ।  
गावहिं सुनहिं सदा मम लीला । हेतु रहित परहित रत सीला ।  
मुनि सुनु साधुन्ह के गुन जेते । कहि न सकहिं सारद श्रुति तेते । ४ ।  
  
  
` They blush to hear themselves praised but feel much delighted to hear  
others' praises. Even-minded and placid, they never abandon the right course.  
Guileless by nature and loving, they are given over to prayer, austerity,  
control of the senses, self- denial and religious observances and undertake  
sacred vows. They are devoted to the feet of their Guru, Lord Govinda (ViShnu)  
and the Brahmanas. They are full of piety, forgiving, friendly to all,  
compassionate, cheerful under all circumstances and sincerely devoted to My  
feet. They are further characterized by dispassion, discretion, modesty,  
knowledge of the truth relating to God as well as by a correct knowledge of  
the Vedas and Puranas. They never take recourse to hypocrisy, pride or  
arrogance nor set their foot on the evil path even by mistake. They are ever  
engaged in singing or hearing My stories and are intent on doing good to  
others without any consideration. In short, O good sage, the qualities of the  
saints are so numerous that they cannot be exhausted even by Sharada ( the  
goddess of speech) nor by the Vedas.' (1-4)  
  
छन्द  
  
कहि सक न सारद सेष नारद सुनत पद पङ्कज गहे ।  
अस दीनबन्धु कृपाल अपने भगत गुन निज मुख् कहे ।  
सिरु नाइ बारहिं बार चरनन्हि ब्रह्मपुर नारद गए ।  
ते धन्य तुलसीदास आस बिहाइ जे हरि रँग रँगे ।  
  
  
`Neither Sharada nor Shesha could tell them!' Even as he heard this the sage  
Narada clasped the Lord's lotus feet. In this way the all-merciful Lord, the  
befriender of the meek, recounted with His own lips the virtues of His  
devotees. Narada bowed his head at the Lord's feet again and again and left  
for the abode of Brahma (the Creator). Blessed are they, says Tulasidasa, who,  
giving up all hopes, are steeped in love for Shri Hari.  
  
दोहा  
  
रावनारि जसु पावन गावहिं सुनहिं जे लोग ।  
राम भगति दृढ़ पावहिं बिनु बिराग जप जोग । ४६ (क) ।  
दीप सिखा सम जुबति तन मन जनि होसि पतङ्ग ।  
भजहि राम तजि काम मद करहि सदा सतसङ्ग । ४६ (ख) ।  
  
  
People who sing or hear the sanctifying praises of Ravana's Foe shall be  
rewarded with steadfast devotion to Shri Rama even without dispassion, japa or  
concentration of mind. The body of a young woman is like fhe flame of a  
candle; be not a moth to it, O my mind. Abandoning lust and pride worship Shri  
Rama and enjoy the company of saints. (46A-B)
