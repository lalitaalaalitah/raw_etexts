 श्रीसुब्रह्मण्यस्तोत्रम् सार्थ   
सुब्रह्मण्यशैलवासिन् स्तोत्रम्   
  
 Hymn to Shri Subrahmanya Translation by A.  Narayanaswami  
नीलकण्ठवाहनं द्विषड्भुजं किरीटिनं  
     लोलरत्नकुण्डलप्रभाभिरामषण्मुखम् ।  
शूलशक्तिदण्डकुक्कुटाक्षमालिकाधरं  
     बालमीश्वरं कुमारशैलवासिनं भजे॥ १॥  
  
I worship the young god who dwells on Kumarasaila, who has the  
peacock as his vehicle, has twice six arms, wears a crown, whose six  
faces are lovely with the brilliance cast by the gem-studded ear  
ornaments he wears, who holds (in his hands) a spear, a (powerful)  
missile, a staff, a cock, and a rosary. 1   
वल्लीदेवयानिकासमुल्लसन्तमीश्वरं  
     मल्लिकादिदिव्यपुष्पमालिकाविराजितम् ।  
झल्लरीनिनादशड़खवादनप्रियं सदा  
     पल्लवारुणं कुमारशैलवासिनं भजे ॥ २॥  
  
I worship the god who dwells on Kumarasaila, joyful in the company of  
(consorts) Valli and Devayani, decked with garlands of divine flowers  
like the jasmine, and who is always fond of playing on the cymbal and  
the resonant conch. 2   
षडाननं कुङ्कुमरक्तवर्णं  
     महामतिं दिव्यमयूरवाहनम् ।  
रुद्रस्य सूनुं सुरसैन्यनाथं  
     गुहं सदा शरणमहं भजे ॥ ३॥  
  
 At all times, I seek refuge with Lord Guha, who has six faces, is  
the color of red vermilion, is supremely intelligent, rides a divine  
peacock, is the son of Rudra (Lord Siva), and is the commander of the  
army of the celestials (Devas). 3   
मयूराधिरूढं महावाक्यगूढं  
     मनोहारी देहं महाचित्तगेहम् ।  
महीदेवदेवं महावेदभावं  
     महादेव बालं भजे लोकपालम् ॥ ४॥  
  
I worship Shri Kartikeya, mounted on a peacock, the knower of the  
secret of the Maha Vakyas, charming of face, residing in the minds of  
the great, the god of the good, the substance of the great Vedas, the  
child of Mahadeva, and the ruler of the worlds.  4   
  
     इति श्री सुब्रह्मण्य स्तोत्रं सम्पूर्णम् ॥  
  
Thus is complete Shri Subrahmanya StotraM  
  
The first two stanzas seem to be related directly to  
kumArashaila.  The third one is a dhyana sloka that is seen  
in other Subrahmanya stotras.  The fourth one is from shri  
subrahmaNya bhujangam.
