 कार्तिकेयस्तोत्रम् प्रज्ञाविवर्धनम्   
              Hymn to kArtikeya or skanda  
  
The following stotra on ska.nda is from the rudra yAmala, an important work  
on tantra . It is a short stotra but also remarkably powerful . The stotra is  
credited with developing the praGYA (intelligence) and has been given by skanda  
himself.  
  
praGYAvivardhana (increasing praGYA) mantras are very important in the vedas  
and other later literature like the tantras . Why is the development of praGYA  
given such importance? The answer is given in the vedas itself . In the  
trisuparNa mantra in the mahAnArAyaNa upanishAd, the following mantras  
occur:    
  
ब्रह्म मेधया ।  
Brahman is attained through intelligence  
मधु मेधया ।  
Bliss is attained through intelligence  
ब्रह्ममेव मधु मेधया ।  
Brahman, which is verily bliss is attained through intelligence  
  
It should however be noted that the intelligence or medhA which is referred to  
here is not the mundane intelligence which we refer to in our daily lives . This  
medhA refers to the development of the buddhi such  
that the truth can be clearly  
seen . shrI ramaNa maharShI gives an analogy to illustrate how the pure and  
clear buddhi perceives brahman . Brahman is hidden from the view of the unclear  
buddhi like dense clouds hiding the sun . The clear buddhi which has been  
obtained by intense sAdhana, sees brahman like a person seeing the sun through  
a thin mist . Thus the jIvanmukta, is different from a person without a clear  
buddhi.  
  
Hence, development of buddhi is given prime importance in our tradition . The  
most famous examples is the gAyatri mantra, which is chanted during the daily  
sandhyAva.ndanam . Another one is the nitya karma for brahmachAris, the  
samitAdAnam . There are various mantras given in the mahAnArAyaNa  
upaniShad itself, the mantra invoking indra (yashChandasAm etc) and the  
medhA sUktam (addressed to sarasvatI and others). There are, of course many  
more such mantras in the vedas.  
  
However, the recitation of these mantras requires learning them from a guru and  
many of us are unable to get such an opportunity, especially in this modern age.  
But, the stotrams from purANAs and the tantras can be chanted by one and all,  
with no exceptions.  
  
In thamiz tradition, skanda, or murukan as he is called, is considered the  
very embodiment of all good and it is held that he is eager to bestow GYAnA to  
one and all . Thus, true to tradition, at the end of the stotram he says that  
anyone chanting his 28 names, even if he is unable to speak will become  
accomplished in speech, like Brihaspati . The person who considers this as mahA  
mantra and chants them will attain mahA praGYA (great intelligence).

The sixteen names are not explained since they are easily understood .  
Some of the names refer to some legends associated with skanda.  
  
Skanda said:    
  
The person who reads my 28 names told here with concentration, in the morning,  
obtains equal status with Brihaspati in speech, even if he cannot speak.  
Further, the person who reads my names as maha mantras obtains great  
intelligence . There is no doubt about this.
