 एकश्लोकी   
  
किं ज्योतिस्तवभानुमानहनि मे रात्रौ प्रदीपादिकं  
   स्यादेवं रविदीपदर्शनविधौ किं ज्योतिराख्याहि मे ।  
चक्षुस्तस्य निमीलनादिसमये किं धीर्धियो दर्शने  
   किं तत्राहमतो भवान्परमकं ज्योतिस्तदस्मि प्रभो ॥  
  
इति श्रीमत्परमहंसपरिव्राजकाचार्यस्य  
श्रीगोविन्दभगवत्पूज्यपादशिष्यस्य  
श्रीमच्छङ्करभगवतः कृतौ एकश्लोकी सम्पूर्णा ॥  
  
  
  
Is it your light that shines in the day as the sun and as the bright  
lamp in the night?  Let it be. Which light shines when i close my eyes?  
(in mental vision) Which light illumines in my intellctual perception?  
You are that supreme light that illumines the awareness of `aham' and  
I am that light.  In short `that thou art' or `ahambrahmasmi.'  
  
  
I am that by the light of which the world is illumined in the day and  
the night also by the lamp, beause the Brahman is the source of all  
light, agni or surya. He is the light through which the indriyas  
function . When the eyes are closed,  there is no perception, the  
eyes implying perception through all indriyas, then the mind  
functions with the help of the intellect , which in its turn  
functions by the light of the atman, which is beyond body, mind and  
intellect and that am I, the supreme reality, Brahman.
