 संस्कृतस्य माहात्म्यम्, सङ्क्षिप्त, विश्वबन्धूलिखित   
  
  
In the words of Jawahar Lal Nehru, `the finest heritage of India  
is the Sanskrit language and literature. This is a magnificent heritage and  
as long as this endures and influences the life of our people, so long the  
basic genius of India will continue.' As William Jones declared about 200  
years ago, Sanskrit is `more perfect than Greek, more copious than Latin, and  
more exquisitely refined than either.' Not only has it provided a rich medium  
for the expression of the countless ideas and the highest ideals which the  
people of India have conceived and pursued during the past ages, but it has  
also deeply influenced and effectively moulded the varied cultural patterns  
of millions upon millions of people living in so many other lands extending  
in all the four directions, thousands of miles beyond the frontiers of India.  
  
It is a veritable mirror of Indian civilization and culture, being the  
repository of a mass of literature which has given expression to the  
intellect and the spirit of India in her progressive march through the great  
creative ages. This literature is copiously rich in religion, philosophy,  
law, linguistics, aesthetics, fine arts, positive and technical sciences,  
gnomic and didactic verse and belles-lettres. It easily transcends in extent  
anything which any ancient or mediaeval literature could show. At the top of  
it, a very large proportion of it possesses an extraordinarily high quality  
which has to be taken into account in assessing its importance not only for  
the people of India but for the entire mankind.  
  
It is, however, not a merely classical language, just enshrining the  
ancient literature of India. It is much more and something of much greater  
significance.  As a language it is an instrument of the greatest precision  
in the delineation of all thought-processes, however deep and subtle, and  
of  all forms of aesthetic and motional perception as well as of spiritual  
intuition and experience. Its study involving the rigorous dialectics of its  
grammar and different systems of Philosophy forms an intellectual discipline  
of the highest order. As a most sonorous and most musical language, it makes  
a never-failing appeal to the deeper aesthetic sensibility of one and all. In  
sooth, it has the power to lift us above ourselves, which is one of its most  
subtle aesthetic and dynamic appeals.  Up till very recent time, Sanskrit as  
a force that welled out from within suifused all aspects of Indian life with  
the waters of a hidden stream of power and beauty, making them flourish with  
vigour. Intellect of India found its culmination in it and, in its turn, it  
has been and still is the one common reservoir from which all the later Indian  
and many Greater Indian languages have been drawing their sap and sustenance.  
  
Sanskrit has always been effective in binding together, culturally, the People  
living in all the parts of India. In this unifying force of Sanskrit lies its  
paramount importance for India of the Present day. The more this perennial  
substratum of emotional oneness and cultural harmony Will flourish, the less  
the fissiparous propensities, which being a part of  the game could not. be  
totally ruled out, Will find it possible to exercise their evil influence  
towards undermining the political unity of the country.  
  
In view of all this, therefore, it augurs well for Bharat of today and  
tomorrow that Sanskrit stands  recognized in its constitution as one of  
its National Languages, concurrently, alongwith its modern spoken regional  
languages and that the Union Government are quite alive to the great need of  
gradually adding more and more to the strength of Sanskrit in the educational  
and cultural set-up in the country.  
  
They have however yet to devise effective ways and means to secure for Sanskrit  
its proper place in the Secondary Education Scheme, maybe, by re-interpreting  
or, if need be, by recasting the Three Language Formula for this purpose. It  
is feared that unless this is done, all other efforts in this direction,  
otherwise, however commendable, might in the long run prove to have been  
like spraying the leaves at the top and douching the trunk and branches in  
the middle of a tree without watering its roots deep down in the ground below.
