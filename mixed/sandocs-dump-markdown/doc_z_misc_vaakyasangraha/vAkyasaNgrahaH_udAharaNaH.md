 Main Shloka:    
  
  
          श्रद्धावाँल्लभते ज्ञानं तत्परः संयतेन्द्रियः ।  
ज्ञानं लब्ध्वा परां शान्तिमचिरेणाधिगच्छति ॥

shraddhAvAn = One with Sincere Faith, labhate = obtains,  
j~nAnaM = Knowledge, saMyatendriyaH = Who has mastered his  
senses, labdhvA = having obtained, shAntiM = peace (mokSha,  
libereation), achireNa = not in long time (quickly),  
adhigachchati = attains  
  
 Meaning (भावार्थ):    
He, who has faith, is devoted to Me and has secured mastery  
over his senses, obtains that knowledge and having got it  
attains quickly shAnti (MokSha, liberation)  
  
 Description:    
This verse occurs in the j~nana yoga chapter of shrImad  
bhagavadgIta.  Shri Krishna is describing to Arjuna the  
essential qualification necessay in an aspirant desirous of  
knowledge which leads to liberation.  That qualification is  
shraddha, which means total dedication and sincerity of  
purpose.  Such devotion and dedication coupled with mastery  
over ones senses leads to true knowledge. When one accquires  
true knowledge, one quickly attains immense peace.  
  
In previous verses, He emphasizes the purifying ability of  
true knowledge. He instructs that a sincere aspirant should  
endeavor to accquire knowledge by prostration, by enquiry,  
and by service. In later verses, He warns that those who  
remain insincere, ignorant, and doubtful perish. Those who  
cannot clear their doubts have neither happiness in this  
world nor the world beyond. He, therefore, urges Arjuna to  
cut asunder the doubts born out of ignorance with knowledge  
accquired through sincere enquiry and stand up for battle.

 Comments:    
Shrimad BhagavadgIta is a very widely available resource  
and there are many interpretations of it avaialable these  
days. Shrimad BhagavadgIta forms the core of vedantic thoughts.  
It is a dailouge between shri Krishna and Arjuna  
(shrikRiShNArjuna saMvada).  It essentially teaches the  
science of the infinte (brahma vidya) and a practical  
methodology (yoga shastra) of reaching that Supreme Reality  
as emphasized at the end of each chapter of it. Any  
interpretation that strays from what is contained in the  
colophon could be potentially a suspect. The tradition has  
given us chiefly three system of interpretation namely,  
Advaita, VishiShThAdaivta and Dvaita meaning monism,  
qualified monism and dualism respectively.  To get to the  
essence of the wisdom contained in it, one would be well  
advised to adhere to one of traditional systems rather  
than accept any and every interpretation.

Follow the path tread by the great, wise people.  
  
 Reference Shloka:    
  
तर्कोऽप्रतिष्ट्टः श्रुतयो विभिन्ना  
     नैको ॠषिर्यस्य मतं प्रमाणम् ।  
धर्मस्य तत्वं निहितं गुहायां  
               महाजनो येन गतः स पन्थाः ॥  
  
  
  
 shabdArtha:    
tarka = logic, apratiShTTaH = not unbiased, shrutaya =  
revelations(vedic scriptures), vibhinnA = many, naiko =  
not one, RiShi = sage(wisemen), mataH = doctrine,  
pramANam= established fact, dharma = right conduct,  
tatvaM = essence, nihitaM = very subtle, guhAyAm =  
secret, mahAjana = great men, gataH = follow,  
panthAH = path  
  
 Meaning (भावार्थ):    
Logical reasoning is not without bias(assumptions),  
vedic revelations are numerous, not one wisemen's thesis  
can be accepted as facts, truely the essence of right  
conduct is a very subtle secret.  So the only recourse is  
walk in the footsteps of great men.  
  
 Description:    
This is a response from yudhiShThira, the eldest of  
pandava brothers, to a query posed by yakSha, a celestial  
being. The original query is what is the way?  
  
YudhiShThira is echoing the wisdom of expereince. He is satating  
that we cannot rely totally on rational thinking as it is not  
without its bias. One has sieve through numerous revelations to  
gain information and it is not handy guide for us. The thesis of  
not one Rishi (scientist, researcher) has been established  
as canonical. With such difficulties facing us in all modes of  
enquiry, what is the way that can leads us out of ignorance  
to knowledge and to right conduct? Only, walking in the footsteps  
of great men ahead us who have experienced the truth can really  
give us the way.

This incident occurs when Pandavas are in exile.  Once during their  
stay in the forests, pandavas are very thirsty.  Yudhishthira sends  
Nakula(youngest) to fetch some water for the rest.  Nakula locates  
a pond after much searching.  Just as he tries to quench his thirst,  
an invisible person's voice asks him to first answer his questions  
before drinking the water.  Nakula is very thirsty and he disregards  
the voice.  As soon as he tries to sip the water, he instantly falls  
down dead.  Meanwhile, yudhiShThira is concerned and sends sahadeva  
to find the whereabouts of Nakula and also get some water.  On  
reaching the pond, Sahadeva also does exactly like his brother and  
falls down unconscious.  Arjuna goes next, finding his brothers lying  
dead, and hearing the heavonly voice, he becomes very furious and  
defiant.  He also first tries to quench his thirst and meets with  
same consequence.  Likewise Bhimasena too, who went next. Finally,  
Yudhishthira arrives and accepts the condition put forth by the  
invisible person.   He  replies each question to the best of his  
reasoning abilities.  We see a fascinating discussion between yakSha  
(lord yama dharmaraja in disguise) and Yudhishthira.  YakSha asks  
crptic questions and Yudhishthira provides refreshingly innovative  
and wonderfully informative answers.  Pleased with the responses,  
yakSha tells him that he can only free one of his brothers. He then  
asks yudhiShThira to choose one from the four. Faced with such  
preplexing choice, Yudhishthira picks Sahadeva!! Surprised by the  
choice, yakSha asks him why he picked Sahadeva over Bhima and Arjuna?  
He calmly replies, Of the sons of Kunthi, I am still alive, but of  
sons of Madri(Makula and Sahadeva) none is alive.  To be fair to my  
mothers, I picked Sahadeva.   Again very impressed by the response,  
lord yama brings all the four paNDavas to life!!  
  
From the example set by Yudhishthira himself it is clear that he is  
great and noble person. The path set by him is worthy of emulation.
