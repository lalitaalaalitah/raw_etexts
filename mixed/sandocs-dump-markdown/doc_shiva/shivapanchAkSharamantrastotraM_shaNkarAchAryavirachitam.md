 शिवपञ्चाक्षरमन्त्रस्तोत्र   
  
  
           A Shivastotra by ShankarAchArya  
          by Anand Hudli  
             ahudli at iupucs.iupui.edu  
The term Shiva means  ``auspicious. '' The God Shiva is  
all-auspiciousness . The mantra namaH ShivAya, used  
to offer salutations to Shiva, is an effective  
prayer to propitiate Shiva . This mantra appears in  
many places in Vedic and Puranic literature.  
For example, the famous shrI Rudram hymn from the  
Yajur Veda, commonly employed to perform the worship  
of the Shiva linga, says: नमः शिवाय च ।  
 The dAridrya dahana stotra of VasiShTha says:    
  
दारिद्र्यदुह्ख-दहनाय नमः शिवाय ।  
  
Salutations to Shiva who burns up the grief caused  
by poverty! Here poverty does not necessarily mean  
material poverty; it also means spiritual poverty.  
This pa.nchAkShara (five syllabled) mantra namaH ShivAya  
is sometimes called the mUla mantra or basic mantra  
of Shiva . Each of the five syllables, na, ma, shi, vA, and  
ya, is held to be so sacred that it represents Shiva even  
by itself.  
The following is the ShivapanchAkShara stotra composed by  
Adi SankarAchArya . One may worship the Shiva linga by  
reciting this stotra and offering bilva leaves.  
  
          शिवपञ्चाक्षरस्तोत्र

नित्याय शुद्धाय दिगम्बराय तस्मै नकाराय नमः शिवाय ॥ १॥  
  
  
Salutations to Shiva, who wears the King of snakes as a  
garland, the Three-eyed God, whose body is smeared with  
ashes, the great Lord, the eternal and pure One, who wears  
the directions as His garment, and who is represented by the  
 ``na '' kAra (term).  
  
मन्दाकिनि-सलिलचन्दन-चर्चिताय नन्दीश्वर-प्रमथनाथ- महेश्वराय ।  
मन्दारपुष्प-बहुपुष्प-सुपूजिताय तस्मै मकाराय नमः शिवाय ॥ २॥  
  
  
I bow to Shiva, who has been worshipped with water from the  
gangA (mandAkini) and annointed with sandalwood paste, the  
Lord of nandI, the Lord of the host of goblins and ghosts,  
the great Lord, who is worshiped with mandAra and many other  
kinds of flowers, and who is represented by the  
syllable  ``ma. ''  
  
शिवाय गौरीवदनाब्ज-वृन्द-सूर्याय दक्षाध्वरनाशकाय ।  
श्रीनीलकण्ठाय वृषध्वजाय तस्मै शिकाराय नमः शिवाय ॥ ३॥  
  
  
Salutations to Shiva, who is all-auspiciousness, Who is the  
sun that causes the lotus face of GaurI (PArvatI) to blossom,  
Who is the destroyer of the Yajna of dakSha, whose throat is  
blue (nIlakaNTha), whose flag bears the emblem of the bull,  
and who is represented by the syllable  ``shi. ''  
  
वसिष्ठ-कुम्भोद्भव-गौतमार्यमुनीन्द्र-देवार्चितशेखराय ।  
चन्द्रार्क-वैश्वानरलोचनाय तस्मै वकाराय नमः शिवाय ॥ ४॥  
  
  
VasiShTha, agastya, Gautama, and other venerable sages, and  
Indra and other Gods have worshipped the head of (Shiva's  
linga). I bow to that Shiva whose three eyes are the moon,  
sun and fire, and who is represented by the syllable  ``va. ''  
  
यक्षस्वरूपाय जटाधराय पिनाकहस्ताय सनातनाय ।  
दिव्याय देवाय दिगम्बराय तस्मै यकाराय नमः शिवाय ॥ ५॥

has matted hair on His head, Who bears the pinAka bow  
in His hand, the Primeval Lord, the brilliant God,  
who is digambara (naked), and who is represented by the  
syllable  ``ya. ''  
  
पञ्चाक्षरमिदं पुण्यं यः पठेच्छिवसन्निधौ ।  
शिवलोकमवाप्नोति शिवेन सह मोदते ॥  
  
  
Anyone who recites this sacred five-syllabled mantra,

of Shiva and rejoices there with Shiva.
