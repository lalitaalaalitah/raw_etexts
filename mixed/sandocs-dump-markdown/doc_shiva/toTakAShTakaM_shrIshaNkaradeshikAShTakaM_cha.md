॥ तोटकाष्टकं श्रीशङ्करदेशिकाष्टकं च ॥  
  
  
Here is an article containing the toTakAShTakam, eight verses  
composed in honor of Adi ShankarAchArya.  
A short description of the advaita paramparA and a short  
account of Shankara's disciple toTaka are included.  
Invocation:    
  
शङ्करं शङ्कराचार्यं केशवं बादरायणम् ।  
सूत्रभाष्यकृतौ वन्दे भगवन्तौ पुनः पुनः ॥  
  
  
I offer obeisances again and again to shrI Veda VyAsa, the author of  
the Brahma sUtras, who is none other than Lord VishNu,  and shrI  
ShankarAchArya, the commentator on those sUtras, who is none other  
than Lord Shiva.  
advaita guru-paramparA:    
  
नारायणं पद्मभुवं वसिष्ठं शक्तिं च तत्पुत्रपराशरं च ।  
व्यासं शुकं गौडपदं महान्तं गोविन्दयोगीन्द्रमथास्य शिष्यम् ॥  
  
श्री शङ्कराचार्यमथास्य पद्मपादं च हस्तामलकं च शिष्यम् ।  
तं तोटकं वार्तिककारमन्यानस्मद्गुरून् सन्ततमानतोऽस्मि ॥  
  
  
These two verses honor the advaita paramparA. The names mentioned here,  
in order, are 1) ShrIman nArAyaNa, 2) BrahmA, 3) VasiShTha, 4) Shakti,  
5) ParAshara, 6) VyAsa, 7) Shuka, 8) GauDapAda, 9) GovindapAda,  
10) ShrI (Adi) ShankarAchArya, and his four disciples, 11) PadmapAda,  
12) HastAmalaka, 13) toTaka, and 14) Sureshvara, and other Gurus.  
Sureshvara is also known as VArttikakAra because he wrote the famous  
vArttika's on the BRihadAraNyaka and taittirIya upaniShads.  
ShrImannArAyaNa instructed the Vedas to BrahmA. The Vedas have no author,  
and are hence called ``apauruSheya.'' Veda VyAsa authored the Brahma sUtra  
and other texts, such as the GItA, to expound the knowledge of the Vedas.  
Jagadguru Adi ShankarAchArya is a unique historical figure of India in  
that he combined within himself the characteristics of a poet, logician,  
an ardent devotee and a mystic and at the same time was the leading exponent  
of the system of philosophy called advaita. In his commentaries on the  
Prasthanatraya, he exhibited a rare faculty of relentlessly logical and  
concatenated argument and refutation, and such subtlety of reasoning as has  
been unsurpassed in the philosophical works of the world.  
His main teachings may be summarized as the affirmation of SamsAra or  
succession of births and deaths due to Karma and its significance, the  
realization of the essential relativity of phenomena in comparsion to the  
reality of the Supreme Self, the realization of that Self not being a  
mere theoretical exercise, but in the nature of the direct realization  
and actual experience taught by the upanishadic saying, tattvam asi,  
``You are That.''  
On the occasion of ShrI Shankara Jayanti, I decided to post the popular  
stotra on Shankara known as ``toTakAShTaka.'' The hymn is so called because  
it has been composed in the difficult but beautiful meter called toTaka.  
There is an interesting history associated with this stotra. Anandagiri  
was one of the less scholarly disciples living with Shankara at Sringeri.  
But Giri, as he was called, was extremely devoted to the AchArya. Giri  
would always engage himself in the service of his Guru. Once it so  
happened  that Shankara was about to begin his usual morning discourse  
on the upanishads and the other disciples started reciting the shAnti  
pATha. But Giri was absent because he had gone to the river to wash his  
Guru's clothes. So Shankara asked the other disciples to wait for Giri's  
return. But PadmapAda, who was obviously proud of his erudition, said,  
``Giri is a dull fellow. He really does not deserve to learn the shAstras.  
What is the point in waiting for him to join us?''  
Shankara decided to humble the pride of PadmapAda and other disciples.  
Out of sheer compassion for Giri, the AchArya blessed him with the  
knowledge of the shAstras, making use of supernatural powers to do so.  
As a result, Giri became a learned scholar instantaneously. Returning  
from the river, he composed the toTakAShTaka, eight verses in praise  
of his Guru. The other disciples were struck with wonder to hear him  
extemporaneously compose the aShTaka in the difficult meter. Giri also  
composed another work, again in the toTaka meter, called the  
ShrutisArasamuddharaNa. Due to the grace of the Guru, Giri became  
a knower of all scriptures, and he earned the respect of PadmapAda and  
other disciples. He came to be known as toTakAchArya, because he was  
an adept in composing verses in the toTaka meter. He became one of Shankara's  
four most important disciples, and was later entrusted with running the  
JyotirmaTh at Badari.  
The above story is from the Shankara digvijaya of Madhava-Vidyaranya.  
           ॥ तोटकाष्टकं ॥  
The toTakAShTaka has been composed in the toTaka meter, in which  
each pAda (quarter) has four sa-gaNa's. Here a sa-gaNa is made up of  
two short syllables followed by a long one. The hymn naturally lends itself  
to be set to music. A suggested RAga is (HindustAni) toDi.  
  
विदिताखिलशास्त्रसुधाजलधे महितोपनिषत् कथितार्थनिधे ।  
हृदये कलये विमलं चरणं भव शङ्कर देशिक मे शरणम् ॥ १॥  
  
  
O knower of the nectar-ocean of the scriptures, the expounder of the  
knowledge of the great upanishadic treasure! I meditate on Your pure lotus  
feet in my heart. O Preceptor Shankara, be my refuge.  
  
करुणावरुणालय पालय मां भवसागरदुःखविदूनहृदम् ।  
रचयाखिलदर्शनतत्त्वविदं भव शङ्कर देशिक मे शरणम् ॥ २॥  
  
  
Save me whose heart is afflicted by the misery of the ocean of births,  
O (You who are) the ocean of compassion! (By Your grace) make me the  
knower of the truths of all the systems of philosophy.  O Preceptor Shankara,  
be my refuge.  
  
भवता जनता सुहिता भविता निजबोधविचारण चारुमते ।  
कलयेश्वरजीवविवेकविदं भव शङ्कर देशिक मे शरणम् ॥ ३॥  
  
  
The people have found happiness due to You, who have the intellect adept in  
the inquiry into Self-knowledge. Make me understand the knowledge of God  
and the soul. O Preceptor Shankara, be my refuge.  
  
भव एव भवानिति मे नितरां समजायत चेतसि कौतुकिता ।  
मम वारय मोहमहाजलधिं भव शङ्कर देशिक मे शरणम् ॥ ४॥  
  
  
You are Lord Shiva Himself. Knowing this my mind is filled with an  
abundance of joy. Put an end to my sea of delusion. O Preceptor Shankara,  
be my refuge.  
  
सुकृतेऽधिकृते बहुधा भवतो भविता समदर्शनलालसता ।  
अतिदीनमिमं परिपालय मां भव शङ्कर देशिक मे शरणम् ॥ ५॥  
  
  
Only after numerous virtuous deeds have been performed in many  
ways, does a keen desire for the experience of Brahman through You arise.  
Protect (me who am) extremely helpless. O Preceptor Shankara, be my refuge.  
  
जगतीमवितुं कलिताकृतयो विचरन्ति महामहसश्छलतः ।  
अहिमांशुरिवात्र विभासि गुरो भव शङ्कर देशिक मे शरणम् ॥ ६॥  
  
  
For the sake of saving the world, (Your) great (disciples) wander assuming  
various forms and guises. O Guru, You shine like the sun (among them).  
O Preceptor Shankara, be my refuge.  
  
गुरुपुङ्गव पुङ्गवकेतन ते समतामयतां नहि कोऽपि सुधीः ।  
शरणागतवत्सल तत्त्वनिधे भव शङ्कर देशिक मे शरणम् ॥ ७॥  
  
  
O Best among the Gurus! The Lord whose flag bears the emblem of the  
bull! You have no equal among the wise. You who are affectionate to those  
who seek refuge! The treasure of truth! O Preceptor Shankara, be my refuge.  
  
विदिता न मया विशदैककला न च किञ्चन काञ्चनमस्ति गुरो ।  
द्रुतमेव विधेहि कृपां सहजां भव शङ्कर देशिक मे शरणम् ॥ ८॥  
  
  
I have neither understood even one branch of knowledge clearly, nor do I  
possess any wealth, O Guru. Quickly bestow on me the compassion which is  
natural to You. O Preceptor Shankara, be my refuge.  
  
इति श्रीमत्तोटकाचार्यविरचितं श्रीशङ्करदेशिकाष्टकं सम्पूर्णम् ।
