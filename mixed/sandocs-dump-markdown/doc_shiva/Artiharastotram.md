 आर्तिहरस्तोत्रम्   
  
  
          Artiharastotram by Sri Sridhara Venkatesa.  
This is a short poem consisting of nine verses. Herein the poet prays  
to Lord Siva to remove the afflictions of the devotee. He asks if it is  
alright for the Lord not to respond to his prayers when He is reputed  
to protect those who even think of Him. Then he says that he is just  
the opposite of the Lord who is omnipotent and omniscient in that he  
is a weakling and ignoramus. How is it, he asks, that Lord has not  
taken pity on him. These verses are very moving in their appeal. The  
poem is a precious gem and the reader would like  to add it to the  
collection of hymns they recite during their prayer.

LIFE OF SRIDHARA VENKATESA  
श्रीकण्ठमिव भास्वन्तं शिवनामपरायणम्।  
श्रीधरं वेङ्कटेशार्यं श्रेयसे गुरुमाश्रये ॥  
Sridhara Venkatesa lived about 300 years ago in  
Tiruvisanallur, a village in Tanjavur district in Tamilnadu. He was called  
Tiruvisanallur Ayyaval (deeply respected person) out of great respect  
people held for him. Even today he is known by that name only. He was  
the son of Lingayaryar who was a minister to the Maharaja of Mysore. Even  
as a young boy Ayyaval was deeply religious and in particular had great  
devotion to Shiva but he made no distinction between Shiva and Vishnu. He  
studied Vedas, shastras and puranas and had a great desire to travel and  
spread the message of the puranas and in particular the glory of Lord's  
name among the people. After his father's death the Maharaja wanted  
him to take his father's job but he politely declined and left Mysore  
state with his wife and mother. He came to Tiruchirapalli in Tamilnadu  
and stayed for some time giving talks. He was supposed to have brought  
back to life a woman who had died by praying to the Lord. This attracted  
people who wanted him to solve their problems. Ayyaval did not like this  
and left the place. He proceeded to Tanjavur. It seems that King Shahaji  
(1684-1710.AD) who was ruling at that time in Tanjavur wanted him to  
stay in Tanjavur but Ayyaval wanted to lead a quiet life. King Shahaji  
was inviting scholarly brahmins to stay in his kingdom. He renamed the  
village Tiruvisanallur as Shahajirajapuram. One street was allotted for  
their stay. Ayyaval also stayed in a house there.  Ayyaval was a proponent  
of the view that in this dark age Kali chanting the lord's name will ward  
off its evil effects. He was the senior contemporary of Bodhendra Swami  
who was the 59th pontiff of the Shankara Math at Kanchipuram and who was  
an ardent advocate of the glory of the lord's name.  Ayyaval wrote a  
book भगवन्नामभूषणम् (Bagavannamabhushanam) on the subject  
which is sadly not available now. Bodhendra Swami had also written a book  
नामामृतरसायनम् (Namamritarasayanam)on the subject wherein  
he had made references to the work of Ayyaval.  Once Ayyaval had to  
perform a sraddha ceremony in his house. Therein food is prepared and  
offered to the departed forefathers who are invoked in three brahmins  
invited for the occasion. When every thing was getting ready Ayyaval  
saw an outcaste with his family in a famished condition begging for  
food. His heart melted with compassion at their condition. Without  
any hesitation he offered them the food that was being prepared for  
the ceremony.He then had the house washed and prepared to conduct the  
ceremony again. But the brahmins in the village considered this act  
reprehensible and refused to conduct the ceremony again. Ayyaval pleaded  
with them quoting texts from the scriptures to support his action but the  
Brahmins were not convinced. He asked them what he should do to remedy  
the situation. They said that the only atonement was having a bath in  
the Ganges. But there was no time to go to Varanasi and return. So he  
prayed to Lord Shiva ( in Gangashtakam) to release the waters of Ganga  
from His matted hair as he did on an earlier occasion for Bhagiratha.  
Water started flowing out of the well in his house and flooded the  
streets of the village.  The villagers got scared and prayed to Ayyaval  
to forgive them and stop the flood that was threatening the village. He  
accordingly prayed again to stop the flooding and requested her to appear  
in the well every year on that day. Even now people flock to that place  
every year on that day and take bath in the waters of the well in the  
belief that Ganga is present in the well on that day.  Ayyaval had  
composed a number of works some of which are not yet been printed and  
some not available. Some of his works are listed below.  (1) Bhagavannama  
Bhushanam. (2) Akhyashashti. (3) Daya satakam. (4) Matrubhtasatakam. (5)  
Stuti paddati. (6) Shivabhakthikalpalatha. (7) Shivabhaktha lakShanam. (8)  
Taravali stotram. (9) Artihara stotram.  (10) Kuliresvarashtakam. (11)  
Jambhunathashtakam. (12) Doshapariharashtakam.  (13) Krishnadwadasa  
manjari. (14) Achyuthashtakam. (15) Dola navarathnamala.  (16)
