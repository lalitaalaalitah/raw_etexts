 जम्बुनाथाष्टकं   
By Shri Sridharavenkatesa  
This hymn is about Jambunatha as Shiva is known at Jambukeshwaram  
(known as Tiruvanaikkaval in Tamil), a place of pilgrimage  
in Tamilnadu. It is on the northern bank of the river Cauvery  
and 5 K.M. north of Trichy. The temple is one of the largest  
(having a spread of nearly 18 acres) and historic temples in the  
country. It dates back to the 13th century and has been visited  
by the great saivaite saints who had sung hymns on the presiding  
deity - Lord Shiva in the temple. It seems that the temple was  
once a forest of jambu trees and there was a Shiva linga under  
one of the trees. So Shiva came to be known as Jambunatha or  
Jambukeshwara. This is a Shiva temple associated with one of  
the five great elements (viz.)  water and so called pancha  
bhoota sthalam (पञ्च भूत स्थलम्). The Shiva lingam  
in the sanctum is always surrounded by water and so is known  
as appu lingam (ap for water). The other places where Shiva is  
worshipped in the form of the great elements are Chidambaram  
(space), Kalahasthi (air), Tiruvannamalai (fire) and Tiruvarur  
(earth).  The temple is known for the historical inscriptions  
and magnificient architecture. It suffered damages during the  
moghul invasion in the 14th century and worship in the temple  
was disrupted. The temple was restored during the Vijayanagar  
rule and the worship also revived. The goddess Parvathi in the  
temple has the name Akilandeshwari. She is said to have meditated  
on lord Shiva here. Her shrine is very famous and attracts  
large number of visitors. Adi Shankaracharya is said to have  
visited the temple and worshipped the Lord and goddess here.  
Legend. As said earlier the Shiva lingam was under a jambu  
tree. Two devotees of Shiva were born as a spider and an  
elephant in the forest due to a curse.  Both were regularly  
worshipping the lord in their own way. The spider would weave  
a web over the lingam to protect it from the falling leaves.  
The elephant brought flowers and water in its trunk for bathing  
the lingam before offering the flowers. But it would clear  
off the web the spider has built first.  This act angered the  
spider very much. Soon a fierce fight broke out between the  
two resulting in the death of both. Pleased with their devotion  
Lord Shiva appeared before them and blessed them. Shince Shiva  
was worshipped by an elephant (Anai in Tamil) here the place  
is called AnaikkA.

LIFE OF SRIDHARA VENKATESA  
श्रीकण्ठमिव भास्वन्तं शिवनामपरायणम्।  
श्रीधरं वेङ्कटेशार्यं श्रेयसे गुरुमाश्रये ॥  
Sridhara Venkatesa lived about 300 years ago in Tiruvisanallur,  
a village in Tanjavur district in Tamilnadu. He was called  
Tiruvisanallur Ayyaval (deeply respected person) out of great  
respect people held for him. Even today he is known by that  
name only. He was the son of Lingayaryar who was a minister to  
the Maharaja of Mysore. Even as a young boy Ayyaval was deeply  
religious and in particular had great devotion to Shiva but he  
made no distinction between Shiva and Vishnu. He studied Vedas,  
shastras and puranas and had a great desire to travel and  
spread the message of the puranas and in particular the glory  
of Lord's name among the people. After his father's death the  
Maharaja wanted him to take his father's job but he politely  
declined and left Mysore state with his wife and mother. He  
came to Tiruchirapalli in Tamilnadu and stayed for some time  
giving talks. He was supposed to have brought back to life  
a woman who had died by praying to the Lord. This attracted  
people who wanted him to solve their problems. Ayyaval did  
not like this and left the place. He proceeded to Tanjavur. It  
seems that King Shahaji (1684-1710.AD) who was ruling at that  
time in Tanjavur wanted him to stay in Tanjavur but Ayyaval  
wanted to lead a quiet life. King Shahaji was inviting  
scholarly brahmins to stay in his kingdom. He renamed the  
village Tiruvisanallur as Shahajirajapuram. One street was  
allotted for their stay. Ayyaval also stayed in a house there.  
Ayyaval was a proponent of the view that in this dark age Kali  
chanting the lord's name will ward off its evil effects. He  
was the senior contemporary of Bodhendra Swami who was the  
59th pontiff of the Shankara Math at Kanchipuram and who was  
an ardent advocate of the glory of the lord's name.  Ayyaval  
wrote a book भगवन्नामभूषणम् (Bagavannamabhushanam)  
on the subject which is sadly not available now. Bodhendra  
Swami had also written a book नामामृतरसायनम्  
(Namamritarasayanam)on the subject wherein he had made  
references to the work of Ayyaval.  Once Ayyaval had to perform  
a sraddha ceremony in his house. Therein food is prepared and  
offered to the departed forefathers who are invoked in three  
brahmins invited for the occasion. When every thing was getting  
ready Ayyaval saw an outcaste with his family in a famished  
condition begging for food. His heart melted with compassion  
at their condition. Without any hesitation he offered them the  
food that was being prepared for the ceremony.He then had the  
house washed and prepared to conduct the ceremony again. But  
the brahmins in the village considered this act reprehensible  
and refused to conduct the ceremony again. Ayyaval pleaded  
with them quoting texts from the scriptures to support his  
action but the Brahmins were not convinced. He asked them what  
he should do to remedy the situation. They said that the only  
atonement was having a bath in the Ganges. But there was no  
time to go to Varanasi and return. So he prayed to Lord Shiva  
( in Gangashtakam) to release the waters of Ganga from His  
matted hair as he did on an earlier occasion for Bhagiratha.  
Water started flowing out of the well in his house and flooded  
the streets of the village.  The villagers got scared and  
prayed to Ayyaval to forgive them and stop the flood that was  
threatening the village. He accordingly prayed again to stop  
the flooding and requested her to appear in the well every  
year on that day. Even now people flock to that place every  
year on that day and take bath in the waters of the well in  
the belief that Ganga is present in the well on that day.  
Ayyaval had composed a number of works some of which are  
not yet been printed and some not available. Some of his  
works are listed below.  (1) Bhagavannama Bhushanam. (2)  
Akhyashashti. (3) Daya satakam. (4) Matrubhtasatakam. (5)  
Stuti paddati. (6) Shivabhakthikalpalatha. (7) Shivabhaktha  
lakShanam. (8) Taravali stotram. (9) Artihara stotram.  
(10) Kuliresvarashtakam. (11) Jambunathashtakam. (12)  
Doshapariharashtakam.  (13) Krishnadwadasa manjari. (14)  
Achyuthashtakam. (15) Dola navarathnamala.  (16) Padamanimanjari  
- a sanskrit dictionary. (17) Shahajiraja charitam.
