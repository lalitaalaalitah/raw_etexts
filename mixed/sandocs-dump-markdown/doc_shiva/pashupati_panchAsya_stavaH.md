COMMENTS:-  
Tha above verses are in praise of Lord Shiva, renowned by the name Pashupati  
in the temple in Nepal.(पञ्च)  pancha means five, (आस्यम्)   
Asyam means the face, and(स्तवम्)  stavam means a hymn in praise. So  
the title says that this is in praise of Lord Pashupati with five faces.  
  
NEPAL: - The kingdom of Nepal is India's neighbour. The state is situated  
high in the Himalaya mountains.  Mount Everest, the highest peak in the  
world, is situated in Nepal.  It is an ancient country and has been referred  
to in our puranas like Skandam and Bhagavatam. The Skanda Purana in the  
chapter Nepala Mahatmayam says that fortunate indeed are those who live in  
that country, because they are blessed with all the four goals(पुरुषार्थाः।)  
of life, to wit, dharma, artha, kama and mokSha. They are able to  
have darshan of the Lord Pashupati whom even devas cannot see directly.  
  
पुरी पाशुपती धन्या चतुर्वर्ग-फलप्रदा ।  
ज्योतीरूपं महालिङ्गं यत्राग्नौ तप्तकाञ्चनम् ॥  
  
धन्या नैपालिका मर्त्याः तद्रूपं गोचरं विभुम् ।  
पश्यन्ति येऽपि देवानां साक्षात्पुनरगोचरम् ।  
  
Nepal is described as a gem amongst holy places. The Skanda Puranam further  
says that the people there will be calm, and will have other good qualities.  
The place is situated in high mountains, among dense forests and has  
remarkable scenic beauty; and in such wonderful surrounding shines  
Lord Pashupatinath as the very embodiment of wisdom. (Nepala mahatmyam.7-54).  
सम्पूर्णे भारतेऽस्मिन्नपि वसु-भरिते भूशिरः-स्थानभूते  
  शश्वच्छान्त्यादि-केन्द्रे हिमगिरि-शिखरेऽभ्युत्तरेऽध्युत्तमेऽन्तः ।  
पुण्ये नैसर्ग-रम्ये परगहन-वने सद्विचित्रे पवित्रे  
  क्षेत्रे नेपाल-सञ्ज्ञे लसति पशुपति-ज्योतिरात्मा चिदीशः ॥  
  
   
It was a Hindu kingdom, the only one in the world, till recently. Here, in  
Nepal, Lord Pashupati is seen as a lingam, nearly four feet high. and with  
five faces - four facing the four directions and the fifth facing up. The  
pujaries draw the Shri Chakra on the lingam daily before commencing the puja.  
The full moon day (paurnamiपौर्णमी ) is specially celebrated when a  
huge quantity of rice is cooked along with vegetables. The rice is shaped  
as a lingam and offered to the Lord and deeparadhanam is performed. The  
temple attracts huge crowds on Shivaratri day when people throng to the  
temple during the entire day to have darshan of the Lord.  
  
FIVE FACES OF SHIVA:- Because of his five faces Shiva has the name  
पञ्चवक्त्रः।  पञ्चसङ्ख्याकानि वक्त्राणि मुखानि नानारूपाणि  
यस्य स तथा ।  (Shivasahasranamam-Padmapuranam).  These faces have  
the following names. ईशान, तत्पुरुष, अघोर, वामदेव, and  
सद्योजात. These faces face up the sky, East, South, North and West  
respectively. It seems that a lingam with five faces as described here is  
to be seen only in the Pashupati temple in Nepal and the temple attached  
to the Shankara math in Tiruvanaikkaval near Trichy. The hymn given in  
the beginning has salutations to the five faces of the Lord.  
  
We have the salutations to Shiva's five faces in Mahanyasam that is chanted  
before chanting the vedic hymn Shri Rudram. There are two Nyasams, the  
Mahanyasam and the Laghunyasam. Maha(महत्)  means big. Laghu is the  
opposite,(लघु)  means light, not heavy. The Mahanyasam is a part of the  
methodology of chanting of the Rudram on special occasions such as Pradosham,  
Shivaratri. Typically, during a Rudra parayanam at home, one recites the  
Laghunyasam. Such a Shri Rudra parayanam in a public place of worship such  
as a temple is preceeded by the recital of the Mahanyasam.  As the name  
difference indicates, the Laghunyasam is shorter.  The Mahanyasam invokes  
the deity of Shri Rudra in His many forms of Indra, Agni, Yama, Varuna etc  
in the different limbs (anga's) of the one who chants. Such an invoking  
is done to seek the blessings of the Lord, and at the same time giving  
one and all a feeling of immediate presence of the Lord in the vicinity  
of the chanting. The Mahanyasam has certain chapters of the Shri Rudram,  
the Purusha Suktam etc repeated in it. The Shiva samkalpam is also part  
of this. The prayers addressed to the five faces of Shiva are given below.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FIVE FACES ;- What is the significance of Shiva  
being said to have five faces? This is explained in detail by Shri  
Nilakanta DikShita in his commentary called Shivatattva rahasyam to  
Shiva 108 Namavali. The nameपञ्चवक्त्रः  is the 52nd name in the  
namavali. A chapter from the elaborate commentary is given below.  
  
तानि च पञ्च मुखानि  
ईशान-तत्पुरुषाघोर-वामदेव-सद्योजाताख्य-पञ्च-  
ब्रह्मात्मकानि, तानि च पञ्चब्रह्माणि भूत- पञ्चक,  
तन्मातृ-पञ्चक, कर्मेन्द्रिय-पञ्चक, ज्ञानेन्द्रिय-पञ्चक,  
पुरुष-प्रकृति-बुद्ध्यहङ्कार मनोरूप-तत्त्व- पञ्चक,  
निवृत्तिप्रतिष्ठाविद्याशान्ति, शान्त्यतीताख्य कला-पञ्चक,  
ब्रह्मा, विष्णु, रुद्र, महेश्वर, सदाशिवाख्य-मूर्ति-पञ्चक,  
शिवसादाख्य, मूर्तसादाख्य, मूर्तसादाख्य-कर्तृसादाख्य-कर्मसादाख्य  
सादाख्य पञ्चकात्मकानीति शिवपुराणागमेषु प्रसिद्धम् ।  
  
A full discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this writeup. One  
may have to approach a scholar for further details on this subject.  
  
`Pashupati' means the protector of the kine. Every thing in creation from  
Brahma the creator down to immovables are known as pashus. Shiva is known  
as Pashupati since He is their Lord. The name occurs in vedas (eg) in Shri  
Rudram that says.नमो वृक्षेभ्यो हरिकेशेभ्यः पशूनां पतये नमः ।   
It also occurs in the Shiva 108 namavali (no.92) and Shiva 1000 namavali. In  
the Shiva sahasranamam(Padmapuranam) (No.44) we find the following.  
  
पशुपतिः - पशूनां ब्रह्मादीनां द्विपदां चतुष्पदां च पतिर्नायकः ।  
``ब्रह्माद्याः स्थावरान्ताश्च पशवः परिकीर्तिताः ।  
तेषां पतित्वाद्विश्वेशो भवः पशुपतिः स्मृतः ॥”  इति पुराणम् ।  
``सर्वदा यत्पशून्पाति तेषु यद्रमते पुनः ।  
तेषामधिपतिर्यच्च तस्मात्पशुपतिः स्मृतः ॥”  इति महाभारतम् ।  
Nepal is therefore known as Pashupatipuri after the Lord.   
  
The river Vangmati flows close to the temple of Pashupati. The waters  
from the river are used for the daily ablutions in the temple. It is said  
that after Lord Narasimha appeared, killed the demon king and blessed  
Prahlada. Then He disappeared from the scene. Prahlada was greatly  
disappointed at this.  He wanted to see the Lord again and did severe  
penance. Lord Shiva was impressed by this and laughed in happiness. Water  
flowed from His mouth at that time and turned into a river. The river that  
flowed from His mouth came to be known as Vangmati. (From Nepala Mahatmyam).  
भगवन्तं तमन्वेष्टुं यदा भागवतो ययौ ।  
तमदृष्ट्वा तपस्तेपे हिमवच्छिखरे शुभे ॥  
  
दृष्ट्वा तं शम्भुरागत्य हास्यमुच्चैश्चकार ह ।  
ततो नदी समुत्पन्ना ह्युन्नतात् गिरिगह्वरात् ॥  
  
वचनान्मम दैत्येन्द्र बहिर्याता यतो नदी ।  
अतोऽस्या वाङ्मती नाम भविष्यति न संशयः ।  
प्रह्लाद गच्छ दैत्येन्द्र विष्णुभक्तिर्दृढाऽस्तु ते ॥  
  
  
Lord Shiva blessed Prahlada that his devotion to Hari will remain firm.  
  
Nepal also has the river Gandaki. Shaligrama stones are found in the  
river bed.  They are symbolic of Lord Vishnu. Shrimad Bhagavatam makes a  
reference to the river in Book 5 - chapter 7 when it narrates the story  
of King Bharata. This country came to be known as Bharata Varsha after  
this king only. The king, after ruling over the country for a long time  
renounced everything and repaired to the forests to the hermitage of  
Sage Pulaha situated on the banks of river Gandaki. It is said that  
Lord Hari reveals His form to His devotees there in the ashram even  
today. The holy river Chakranadi (Gandaki) hallows on both sides the  
places of this ashrama through contact with circular (wheel like)  
pebbles on both sides.This place is known as the ShaligramakShetra.  
  
एवं वर्षायुतसहस्रपर्यन्तावसितकर्मनिर्वाणावसरोऽधिभुज्यमानं  
स्वतनयेभ्यो रिक्थं पितृपैतामहं यथादायं विभज्य

यत्र ह वाव भगवान् हरिरद्यापि तत्रत्यानां

यत्राश्रमपदान्युभयतोनाभीभिर्दृषच्चक्रैश्चक्रनदी नाम

HISTORICAL NOTES:-  
The documents in the National Archives of Nepal reveal that Shri  
Shankaracharya visited Nepal during his travels around the country. He  
had discussions with the then king of Nepal who was a Buddhist and weaned  
him away from Buddhism to Hinduism. He made changes to the way pujas were  
being done in Pashupatinath temple and arranged to have regular pujas done  
by priests got from South India. Four priests, properly trained in the  
temple procedures and recitng the vedas perform the pujas to the four faces  
on the four sides. These facts are also to be seen in the text Punyashloka  
manjari that deals with the history of the Kanchi Shankara math.  It also  
says that Shri Vipulananda Sadashiva - the 53rd acharya in the lineage of  
acharyas of the math visited Nepal. He was warmly received by the king and  
honoured by him. The following verse in the text says that.    
निजनीवृदग्रहेतिखेदत्यजनेपालनृपालपूज्यपादः ।  
स पुरो मम साधु सन्निधत्तां विफलाननदसदाशिवोऽप्रमत्तः ॥  
  
  
This fact is also mentioned as  
नेपालादिनृपालमौलिविधृतश्रीशासन ...  
  
in the Vyasachaliya Shankaravijayam ..  
  
Shri Vyasachala was the disciple of Shri Vipulananda Sadashiva  
and succeded him as the 54th head of the math. He is the author of  
Vyasachaliya Shankaravijayam.  The details show that the Shri Vipulananda  
Sadashiva visited Nepal when it was in the grip of severe famine. He  
blesed the state and brought relief from the severe famine.  
  
Now, before concluding, let us ponder as to what we should seek from  
Lord Pashupati. Shri Shankaracharya, in his Shivanandalahari (verse No.68)  
shows us the way. Let us join him in this moving appeal to Lord Pashupati.  
अमितमुदमृतं मुहुर्दुहन्तीं  
     विमल-भवत्पद-गोष्ठमावस्न्तीम् ।  
सदय पशुपते सु-पुण्य-पाकं  
     मम परिपालय भक्ति-धेनुमेकाम् ॥ ६८॥  
  
  
Pashu(पशु)  means cattle in general. Here the acharya takes it to mean  
a cow.  The `cow' in this instance is devotion or bhakti. Lord Pashupati  
is the owner of the cow. The acharya requests the Lord to take care of  
the bhakti `cow' and nourish it or, in other words, make his devotion to  
Him firm and unwavering.  The cow shed will generally be unclean. But the  
bhakti cow will not stay in unclean places. It stays in a very clean place  
(viz.) the Lord's feet.विमल-भवत्पद-गोष्ठमावसन्तीम्।  
विमल  = clean, pure.  भवत्पद-गोष्ठमावसन्तीम्  = staying  
in the cow-pen of your feet.गोष्ठम्  = cowpen.  This implies that  
the place where bhakti resides is a very exalted one. The ordinary cow  
can give only milk, in limited quantities and that too at specific times  
only. This bhakti cow is capable of giving us many good things - and that  
too all the time and in abundance and most importantly the nectar called  
`bliss' .  So, अमितमुदमृतं मुहुर्दुहन्तीम्। अमित  = unlimited.   
मुदम्  = joy, happiness.  अमृतं  = nectar.  दुहन्तीम्  =  
yielding.मुहुः  = often, frequently.  The cow will be tied to a peg  
fixed to the ground. Bhakti is the result of good deeds or punyam done in  
many births.  So, the bhakti cow is tied to the peg that is the frution  
of good deeds or punyam done in numerous births.सुपुण्य-पाकाम् ।  The  
Lord is requested to take care of such a cow. Lord Pashupati is addressed  
asसदय पशुपते = O! the compassionate Pashupati!. This indicates  
that the Lord has a kind heart and will certainly listen to our pleading.
