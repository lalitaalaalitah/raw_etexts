Uniqueness:    
  
This Shivastrotra is unique in many ways. I list some of the unique  
aspects of the strotra below:    
  
1. If you take first Sanskrit syllable from each of the shloka above  
and arrange them horizontally  
you get   .. OM namaH shivAya .. (I bow down to Shiva)  
  
2. The entire composition is composed to be sung in ᳚raga Bhairava᳚.  
Raga Bhairava is assumed to be the original creation of music by  
Shiva through his drum called ᳚DamarU᳚  
  
3. However, each of the shloka can be sung in seven basic ᳚ragas᳚ of  
Hindustani classical. Pundit Bhimsen Joshi has done it. He has sung  
each sloka in different raga.  
  
Philosophic comments:    
  
The ``shivlinga'' has many iconographic and symbologic interpretations.  
The most popular, which has caught the fancy of the Westerners, is  
that the ``linga᳚ is a phallus of Shiva. This phallus cult is  
relatively young cult and the reasons surrounding its developments  
are not clear.  
  
The original Vedic Iconography indicates that Shiva was a pall of  
fire spreading many light years in all direction that emerged just  
after the ``quantum chaos᳚ at the beginning of the universe. Many  
Sanskrit scholars believe that the ``quantum chaos᳚ was indeed the  
``pashupata-astra᳚(पशुपतास्त्र) that Shiva is supposed to be  
wielding. Iconographic interpretation of shivlinga as a ᳚enormous  
power locked inside a hard black stone cooled perpetually by water  
and guarded vigilantly by a security in form of Vasuki- the most  
venomous snake᳚ is also popular  (not to miss the shape which  
resembles the modern Nuclear reactor).  
  
The above strotra, it may not be wrong to argue, has its ideological  
origins in the original school of ``adhikrut sankhya᳚(अधिकृत  
साङ्ख्य)
