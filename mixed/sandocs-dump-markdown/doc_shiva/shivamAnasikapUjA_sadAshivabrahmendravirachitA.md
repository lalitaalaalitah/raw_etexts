 शिवमानसिकपूजा   
सदाशिवब्रह्मेन्द्र विरचिता  
  
अनुचितमनुलपितं मे त्वयि ननु शम्भो तदागसः शान्त्यै ।  
अर्चां कथमपि विहितामङ्गीकुरु सर्वमङ्गलोपेत ॥ १॥   
O Shambhu, accompanied by Parvati, indeed unfitting words  
have been said about you by me. Towards expiation of this sin,  
somehow please accept the worship offered (by me).  
  
ध्यायामि कथमिव त्वां धीवर्त्मविदूरदिव्यमहिमानम् ।  
आवाहनम् विभोस्ते देवाग्र्य भवेत् प्रभो कुतः स्थानात् ॥ २॥   
How can I meditate upon you (perform DhyAnam), who are  
beyond the range of the intellect? O foremost among Devas,  
from which place can one invoke you (perform AvAhanam),  
you being all-pervading.  
  
कियदासनं प्रकल्प्यं कृतासनस्येह सर्वतोऽपि शिव ।  
पाद्यं कुतोऽर्घ्यमपि वाऽऽपाद्यं सर्वत्रपाणिपादस्य ॥ ३॥   
O Shiva, how large a seat must be set for you, who are  
seated all around? Whence can water for feet (PAdyam) or as  
a respectful offering (Arghyam) be given to you whose hands  
and feet are everywhere.  
  
आचमनं ते स्यादपि भगवन् भव सर्वतोमुखस्य कथम् ।  
मधुपर्को वा कथमिह मधुवैरिणि दर्शितप्रसादस्य ॥ ४॥   
O Bhagavan! O Bhava! How can Achamanam (water to sip) be  
possible for you whose faces are everywhere? How can Madhuparka  
(milk and honey) be given to you, who favours the enemy of Madhu  
(Vishnu, the slayer of the demon Madhu).  
  
स्नानेन किं विधेयं सलिलकृतेनेह नित्यशुद्धस्य ।  
वस्त्रेणापि न कार्यं देवाधिपते दिगम्बरस्येह ॥ ५॥   
What is the necessity of a bath, done with water, to one who  
is eternally pure? O Lord of the Devas, there is no use of a  
garment to you who wears only the directions.  
  
स्फुरति हि सर्पाभरणं सर्वाङ्गे सर्वमङ्गलाकार ।  
अतिवर्णाश्रमिणस्तेऽस्त्युपवीतेनेह कःस्विदुत्कर्षः ॥ ६॥   
O one who has the most auspicious one (Parvati) in your form! In  
all your limbs, snakes shine forth as ornaments. What sanctity  
can come through the sacred thread to you, who are beyond the  
Varnas and Ashramas?  
  
गन्धवती हि तनुस्ते गन्धाः किं नेश पौनरुक्त्याय ।  
पुष्करफलदातारं पुष्करकुसुमेन पूजये किं त्वाम् ॥ ७॥   
O Lord! Are not perfumes redundant to you whose body is  
fragrant? Can I worship you with Pushkara (lotus) flowers,  
when you are the giver of Pushkara (abundant, complete) fruits?  
  
शमधनमूलधनं त्वं सकलेश्वर भवसि धूपितः केन ।  
दीपः कथं शिखावान् दीप्येत पुरः स्वयम्प्रकाशस्य ॥ ८॥   
O lord of all! You are the chief wealth of Rishis who value  
tranquility, so how can you be incensed (worshipped with  
incense)? How can even a flaming lamp burn bright before the  
self-effulgent one?  
  
अमृतात्मकमपि भगवन्नशनं किन्नाम नित्यतृप्तस्य ।  
त्वय्याम्रेडितमेतत् ताम्बूलं यदिह सुमुखरागेऽपि ॥ ९॥   
O Lord! Even ambrosial food, what does it mean to one who  
is always content? TO you, who is always pleasant-faced (or  
red-lipped), this betel leaf offering is duplication indeed.  
  
उपहारीभूयादिदमुमेश यन्मे विचेष्टितमशेषम् ।  
नीराजयामि तमिमं नानात्मानं सहाखिलैः करणैः ॥ १०॥   
O Lord of Uma! Whatever is effected by me, may all this be an  
offering (to you). I shall perform Neerajanam (waving of lamps)  
with all my instruments (mind, body and speech) to the one who  
is manifest as diverse objects.  
  
सुमनश्शेखर भव ते सुमनोऽञ्जलिरेष को भवेच्छम्भो ।  
छत्रं द्युमन् द्युमूर्ध्नश्चामरमपि किं जितश्रमस्य तव ॥ ११॥   
O Shambhu, best among Gods (or one wearing flowers on your  
head), what use does this handful of flowers have for you? O  
effulgent one! Of what use is an umbrella to one whose head is  
the sky, or a fan or fly-whisk to one who has conquered fatigue?  
  
नृत्यं प्रथतां कथमिव नाथ तवाग्रे महानटस्येह ।  
गीतं किं पुरवैरिन् गीतागममूलदेशिकस्य पुरः ॥ १२॥   
O Lord! How can dance be performed before you, the great  
dancer? O destroyer of the Tripuras! What music can be rendered  
before the primary teacher of the (Sama) Veda that is the  
source of all music.  
  
वाद्यं डमरुभृतस्ते वादयितुं वा परेऽस्ति का शक्तिः ।  
अपरिच्छिन्नस्य भवेदखिलेश्वर कः प्रदक्षिणविधिस्ते ॥ १३॥   
O lord of everything! Who indeed can have the ability to  
play an instrument to you, the bearer of the Damaru (hand-held  
drum)? What rules of circumambulation can be followed towards  
you, who are all-pervading  
and immeasurable?  
  
स्युस्ते नमांसि कथमिव शङ्कर परितोऽपि विद्यमानस्य ।  
वाचामगोचरे त्वयि वाक्प्रसरो मे कथन्नु सम्भवतु ॥ १४॥   
O Shankara! How can prostrations be offered to you, who are  
present all-around? How can my praises expound you, who are  
beyond the domain of words?  
  
नित्यानन्दाय नमो निर्मलविज्ञानविग्रहाय नमः ।  
निरवधिकरुणाय नमो निरवधिविभवाय तेजसेऽस्तु नमः ॥ १५॥   
Salutations to the ever-blissful one, to the one who embodies  
pure consciousness. Salutations to the radiance that is  
limitless in mercy and in glory  
  
सरसिजविपक्षचूडः सगरतनूजन्मसुकृतमूर्धाऽसौ ।  
दृक्कूलङ्कषकरुणो दृष्टिपथे मेऽस्तु धवलिमा कोऽपि ॥ १६॥   
May this white radiance be in the path of my vision, that which  
wears the moon (enemy of the lotus) as crest-jewel, that which  
bears the Ganga (purifier of the sons of Sagara) on the head  
and that which has compassion overflowing from the eyes.  
  
जगदाधारशरासं जगदुत्पादप्रवीणयन्तारम् ।  
जगदवनकर्मठशरं जगदुद्धारं श्रयामि चित्सारम् ॥ १७॥   
I seek refuge in the embodiment of consciousnees, who has the  
Meru, the support of the earth, as a bow, has Brahma who is  
adept at creating this world, as charioteer and has Vishnu  
who is skillful at protecting the world, as an arrow and is  
the saviour of the world.  
  
कुवलयसहयुध्वगलैः कुलगिरिकूटस्थकुचभरार्धाङ्गैः ।  
कलुषविदूरैश्चेतः कवलितमेतत् कृपारसैः कैश्च ॥ १८॥   
This (my) mind has been swallowed by some compassionate one  
devoid of all impurities, whose neck rivals the blue-lily,  
and half of whose body is Parvati (whose breasts are like  
ancestors to the chief mountains.)  
  
वसनवते करिकृत्त्या वासवते रजतशैलशिखरेण ।  
वलयवते भोगभृता वनितार्धाङ्गाय वस्तुनेऽस्तु नमः ॥ १९॥   
Salutations to that object that has garments made with  
elephant-hide, has an abode with the peak of the silvery  
hill Kailasa, has bracelets with snakes, and that has a  
woman (Parvati) in half the body.  
  
सरसिजकुवलयजागरसंवेशनजागरूकलोचनतः ।  
सकृदपि नाहं जाने सुरमितरं भाष्यकारमञ्जीरात् ॥ २०॥   
Not once do I consider any god apart from the one whose eyes  
are diligent in making the lotus and lily bloom and close  
(i.e. whose eyes are the sun and the moon), and who wears the  
snake Patanjali (author of the Mahabhasya) as his anklet.  
  
आपाटलजाटानामानीलच्छायकन्धरासीम्नाम् ।  
आपाण्डुविग्रहाणामाद्रुहिणं किङ्करा वयं महसाम् ॥ २१॥   
Beginning with Brahma, we are all the servants of the radiance  
that has pale red matted locks, that has blue-hued throat  
surface and that has a white form.  
  
मुषितस्मरावलेपे मुनितनयायुर्वदान्यपदपद्मे ।  
महसि मनो रमतां मे महति दयापूरमेदुरापाङ्गे ॥ २२॥   
May my mind rejoice in the great brilliance that robs  
Manmatha’s pride, has lotus feet that were generous in  
granting eternal life to Markandeya (the son of the Rishi  
Mrikandu), and has side glances overflowing with the flood  
of compassion.  
  
शर्मणि जगतां गिरिजानर्मणि सप्रेमहृदयपरिपाके ।  
ब्रह्मणि विनमद्रक्षणकर्मणि तस्मिन्नुदेतु भक्तिर्मे ॥ २३॥   
May devotion arise in me towards the supreme being who is the  
joy of the worlds, who sports with Parvati, who has a heart  
softened with love, and who takes on the task of protecting  
those who supplicate.  
  
अस्मिन्नपि समये मम कण्ठच्छायाविधूतकालाभ्रम् ।  
अस्तु पुरो वस्तु किमप्यर्धाङ्गेदारमुन्मिषन्निटिलम् ॥ २४॥   
At this very time, may that incomprehensible object, that  
relegates the dark cloud with its throat’s brilliance,  
that has a wife in half the body, and that has a sparking  
(eye in the) forehead, be in front of me.  
  
जटिलाय मौलिभागे जलधरनीलाय कन्धराऽऽभोगे ।  
धवलाय वपुषि निखिले धाम्ने स्यान्मामको नमोवाकः ॥ २५॥   
May my words of salutations be towards that resplendent one  
who has matted locks on his head, who is blue as a cloud in  
the throat region, and who is white in his entire body.  
  
अकरविराजत्सुमृगैः अवृषतुरङ्गैरमौलिधृतगङ्गैः ।  
अकृतमनोभवभङ्गैरलमन्यैर्जगति देवतापशदैः ॥ २६॥   
Enough of those inferior gods upon this earth, who do not  
have a lovely deer in their hands, who do not have a bull as  
vehicle, who do not bear Ganga on their heads, and who did  
not destroy Manmatha.  
  
कस्मै वच्मि दशां मे कस्येदृग्घृदयमस्ति शक्तिर्वा ।  
कस्य बलं चोद्धर्तुं क्लेशात् त्वामन्तरा दयासिन्धो ॥ २७॥   
O ocean of mercy! Apart from you, to whom will I narrate  
my state?  Who would have such a heart or such power? Who has  
the strength to deliver from distress?  
  
याचे ह्यनभिनवं ते चन्द्रकलोत्तंस किञ्चिदपि वस्तु ।  
मह्यं प्रदेहि भगवन् मदीयमेव स्वरूपमानन्दम् ॥ २८॥   
O one wearing the crescent moon! I beseech you for some object  
which is not new. O Lord! Give me my own blissful nature (which  
I am unaware of).  
  
भगवन् बालतया वाऽभक्त्या वाऽप्यापदाकुलतया वा ।  
मोहाविष्टतया वा माऽस्तु च ते मनसि यद्दुरुक्तं मे ॥ २९॥   
O Lord! May my improper words not be held in your heart, those  
spoken due to childishness, or lack of devotion or agitation  
due to distress, or being enveloped by delusion.  
  
यदि विश्वाधिकता ते यदि निगमागमपुराणयाथार्थ्यम् ।  
यदि वा भक्तेषु दया तदिह महेशाशु पूर्णकामः स्याम् ॥ ३०॥   
O great god! If it is true that you are superior to all else in  
the universe, and the Vedas, Agamas and Puranas are accurate,  
and you have compassion for your devotees, then I shall surely,  
speedily have all my desires fulfilled.
