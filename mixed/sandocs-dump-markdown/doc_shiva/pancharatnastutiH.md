 पञ्चरत्नस्तुती   
  
       Pancharatnastuti of Shri Appayya Dixita  
Introduction  
This short poem made of five gem like verses establishes the  
greatness of Lord Paramasiva based on the authority of the  
vedas and puranas. Sri Dixita had also written a commentary on  
the verses. It contains a systematic exposition of the theme of  
the poem (viz.) the supremacy of  Paramasiva as parabrahman by  
a discussion of the many scriptural passages. It is a brilliant  
discussion by a great scholar.  
  
Background  
It seems that during his period there was much unseemly  
squabble between the adherents of Siva and Vishnu as to who  
was the greater of the two. Sri Dixita was saddened by this  
spectacle. It appears that some of the adherents of Vishnu  
went to the extent of condemning the Saivashastras as tamasic  
and Siva Himself as a jiva only. Sri Dixita was very much  
pained at all these happenings and was forced to espouse the  
other side (viz) supremacy of Siva. Even though in this poem  
the author argues to establish the supremacy of Lord Siva,  
it has to be emphasised that he had no bias towards Siva or  
Vishnu. He had mentioned this in many places in his works. His  
Hariharabedhastuti is an example of his attitude. In this  
stotra he praises both Lord Siva and Vishnu in each verse. In  
the last verse he says clearly that he sees no difference  
between them. It reads as follows.  
  
वस्तां पिशङ्गं वसनं दिशो वा गरुत्मता यातु ककुद्मता वा ।  
निद्रातु वा नृत्यतु वाऽधिरङ्गे भेदो न मे स्यात्परमस्य धाम्नः ॥  
In fact, he had composed Varadarajastava which shows his intense  
devition to Lord Vishnu. He had also written commentaries on  
Yadavabhyudayam of Sri Vedanta Desika. All these go to show  
his liberal mind. He was, in fact, a true advaitin.
