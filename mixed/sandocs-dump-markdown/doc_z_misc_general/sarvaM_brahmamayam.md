 सर्वं ब्रह्ममयं   
  
सर्वं ब्रह्ममयं रे रे ॥  
  
     किं वचनीयं किमवचनीयं ।  
     किं रसनीयं किमरसनीयम् ॥ १  
किं पठनीयं किमपठनीयं ।  
किं भजनीयं किमभजनीयम् ॥ २  
     किं बोद्धव्यं किमबोद्धव्यं ।  
     किं भोक्तव्यं किमभोक्तव्यम् ॥ ३  
सर्वत्र सदा हंस ध्यानं ।  
कर्तव्यं भो मुक्ति-निदानम् ॥ ४  
  
सर्वं ब्रह्ममयं रे रे ॥  
  
  
Song composed by Sadashiva Brahmendra  
  
Everything is Brahma Mayam; All is just the Almighty’s presence.  
  
1. What may be spoken and what may not be spoken, what can  
be created and what may not be created (in relation to poetry  
or otherwise).  
2. What may be studied and what not to be studied, what may  
be recited and what may not be recited.  
3. What may be taught and what may not be taught; what may  
be enjoyed and what may not be enjoyed – everything is HIS  
creation and HIS work.  
4. So, always immerse yourself in his dhyaanam and that will  
take you towards ‘salvation’  
The short message of this song is do not enter into arguments  
and discussions as to what is right and what is wrong; all  
that would be meaningless and unnecessary. What is meaningful  
is ‘Pray him’ and ‘Merge in him’
