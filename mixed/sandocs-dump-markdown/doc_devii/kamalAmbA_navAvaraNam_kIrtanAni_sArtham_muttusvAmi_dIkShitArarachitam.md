 कमलाम्बा नवावरणं सार्थम्   
  
The set of compositions, popularly known as ''KamalAmbA  
NavAvaraNam'' is a series of eleven kIrtanam-s composed by the  
illustrious composer, ShrI MuttusvAmi DIkShitar, in praise  
of Goddess KamalAmbA of the mammoth temple at TiruvArUr. This  
work is one of the peaks of his creativity. Be it the meaning,  
the rAga or the structure, each one of the kritis is a gem.  
  
In this intellectual project, the composer is at his best,  
the lyrics are superb and steeped in devotion, the theme is  
lofty, and everything is indeed 'par excellence'!!  
  
The shrine of Goddess kamalAmbA  
  
TiruvArUr is a small town in the south Indian district of  
Ta~njAvUr, about 35 miles east of the town of Ta~njAvUr,  
situated as a railway junction between NAgapaTTaNam and  
Ta~njAvur, as well as between MayilAdutturai and KAraikkuDi,  
in the KAveri river delta. This is the location of the  
vast temple complex dedicated to Lord TyAgarAja (Shiva).  
Seven temples in the vicinity of TiruvArUr are designated as  
'sapta viTa~Nka kShetram'-s of TyAgarAja (somAskanda), and  
the foremost among them is the 'vIthI viTa~Nka' TyAgarAja of  
the majestic TiruvArUr temple. The massive structure of this  
temple is enclosed in a huge quadrangle that measures 846 feet  
in length, and 666 feet in breadth. There are four gopurams  
(temple towers) on the four sides, and three smaller ones  
inside the complex. The eastern entrance is vast and spacious  
(110 feet by 60 feet), and has the huge rAja gopuram (main  
temple tower) 120 feet tall. It is a gigantic five-tiered  
structure topped with 11 'kalasham'-s (sacred pots), and has  
the unique and unusual feature that it abruptly diminishes in  
size as it rises. There are three prAkArams (complex walls,  
circumambulatory paths) in this temple, and numerous shrines  
too many to count, big and small, are scattered throughout.  
  
The TyAgarAja shrine is located in the innermost prAkAram,  
to the south of the ValmIkanAtha (pRRithvI li~Ngam or ValmIka  
li~Ngam-ant-hill)) shrine within the same prAkAram. Both  
share a common mukha maNDapam. Four other important shrines,  
HATakeshvara, Acaleshvara, SiddhIshvara, Anandeshvara are  
located at the four cardinal points (southewest, southeast,  
northeast, and northwest, respectively) of the middle  
prAkAram. The consort of TyAgarAja is NIlotpalAmbA, the  
goddess of blue lotus. In TevAram songs, she is affectionately  
addressed in tamil as ``alliyankotai''. Her shrine is located in  
the second prAkAram on the right side.  The unique feature is  
that here, nIlotpalAmbA is depicted as blessing her second son,  
skanda (subrahmaNya) with her hand on his forehead.  
  
The KamalAmbA shrine is in the northwest corner of the outermost  
prAkAram, well away from the main shrines, with its own MaNDapam  
and circumambulatory passages that makes an angle with the  
prAkAram wall. This shrine is traditionally and ritually  
unconnected with the main shrine of TyAgarAja. Here, the  
Goddess is depicted in a meditating posture. While NIlotpalAmbA  
is supposed to represent the ``bhoga shakti'' of Lord Shiva,  
KamalAmbA represents the ``yoga shakti''. It is to be observed  
that muttusvAmi dIkShitar never associated kamalAmbA with  
TyAgarAja, and considered only NIlotpalAmbA as the consort  
of the deity. All the eleven kIrtanams of the KamalAmbA  
NavavAvaraNam series are engraved in marble slabs on the walls  
at the entrance to the main sanctorum of Goddess KamalAmbA.  
  
The huge tank, kamalAlayam is located on the western side  
of the temple complex. and covers an enormous area of 25  
acres (compared to only 20 acres area of the temple complex).  
There is a shrine dedicated to nAganAthasvAmi in the middle of  
the tank, approached only by boat. The grand float festival  
that takes place in this tank is indeed very magnificent.  
  
The KamalAmbA NavAvaraNa KIrtanam-s  
  
The series consists of eleven compositions, all in praise  
of Goddess KamalAmbA. It starts with a 'dhyAna kIrtanam'  
(benediction), followed by eight composition, one in each  
of the eight vibhaktis of the proper noun ``kamalAmbA''  
(or sometimes ``kamalAmbikA'') in feminine gender  
continuing on to a ninth kIrtanam which employs all the eight  
declensions of the sanskrit language;  
the series concludes with an auspicious 'ma~NgaLa kIrtanam',  
appropriately set in the auspicious rAgam shrI. Each of the nine  
vibhakti songs in on one of the nine AvaraNams (enclosures)  
of the ``shrI chakram'' (the auspicious wheel) belonging to the  
doctrine of shrIvidya (auspicipus wisdom).  
  
The kIrtanams of the KamalAmbA NavAvaraNa series are as follows:    
  
dhyAna kIrtanam in saMbodhanA vibhakti (vocative case )-  
``kamalAmbike'', toDi rAgam, rUpaka tALam.  
  
The first AvaraNa kIrtanam in prathamA vibhakti (nominative case) -  
``kamalAmbA saMrakShatu mAm'', Anandabhairavi rAgam, tripuTa tALam  
(on trailokya-mohana chakram).  
  
The second AvaraNa kIrtanam in dvitIyA vibhakti (accusative case) -  
``kamalAmbAM bhaja re'', kalyANi rAgam, Adi tALam  
 (on sarvAshA-paripUraka chakram).  
  
The third AvaraNa kIrtanam in tRRitIyA vibhakti (instrumental case) -  
``shrIkamalAmbikayA'', sha~NkarAbharaNa rAgam, rUpaka tALam  
(on sarva-saMkShobhaNa chakram).  
  
The fourth AvaraNa kIrtanam in chaturthI vibhakti (dative case) -  
``kamalAmbikAyai'', kAmbhoji rAgam, aTa tALam  
(on sarva-saubhAgyadAyaka chakram).  
  
The fifth AvaraNa kIrtanam in paऽnchamI vibhakti (ablative case) -  
``shrI kamalAmbikAyAH'', bhairavi rAgam, jhaMpa tALam  
(on sarvArtha-sAdhaka chakram).  
  
The sixth AvaraNa kIrtanam in ShaShThI vibhakti (genitive case) -  
``kamalAmbikAyAH'', punnAgavarALi rAgam, rUpaka tALam  
(on sarva-rakShAkara chakram).  
  
The seventh AvaraNa kIrtanam in saptamI vibhakti (locative case) -  
``shrI kamalAmbikAyAm'', sahAnA rAgam, tripuTa tALam  
(on sarva-roga-hara chakram).  
  
The eighth AvaraNa kIrtanam in sambodhanA vibhakti (vocative case) -  
``shrI kamalAmbike'', ghaNTA rAgam, Adi tALam  
(on sarva-siddh-iprada chakram).  
  
The ninth (and the last) AvaraNa kIrtanam, employing all  
the eight vibhaktis (cases)-  
``'srI kamalAmbA jayati'', Ahiri rAgam, rUpaka tALam  
(on sarvAnanda-maya chakram). The pallavi employs prathamA  
vibhakti, the anupallavi, the dvitIyA (the first three lines),  
and tRRitIyA vibhakti (rest of the anupallavi), while the  
charaNam has one line each in chaturthI, pa~nchamI, and ShaShThI  
and saptamI vibhaktis. The line set in chaturthI vibhakti also  
incorporates the sambodhanA vibhakti, while the last two lines  
in madhyamakAla return to the prathamA vibhakti.  
  
The final auspicious ma~NgaLa kIrtanam, again in saMbodhanA  
vibhakti (vocative case)-``shrI kamalAmbike'', shrI rAgam,  
khaNDa eka tALam.  
  
In each kIrtanam, MuttusvAmi dIkShitar carefully brings out  
several tAntrik details, the name of the chakram, its geometry,  
many salient features that are specific to the chakram, and  
the devatas and sub-deities associated with it. On many  
occasions, dIkShitar cleverly indulges in very lengthy word  
constructions, which to a layman may seem like a tongue-twister.  
The phrase ``guruguha'' (used in several meanings) appears in  
all these compositions as the composer's signature (mudra).  
The rAga mudra is incorporated (through the art of shleSham  
(double meaning), in most of these compositions. The dhyAna  
kIrtanam in the rAgam toDi does not feature a rAga mudra,  
and the kIrtanams in rAgams Anandabhairavi (the first AvaraNa  
kIrtanam), and sha~NkarAbharaNam (the third AvaraNa kIrtanam)  
have only partial rAga mudras (the word ``Ananda'' for the  
former, and sha~Nkara for the latter). The kAmbhoji, sahAnA,  
and Ahiri compositions have disguised rAga mudras (kAmbhoja,  
shAna, Ahari, respectively). All other kRRitis have the proper  
rAga mudra built into the sAhityam.  
  
The shrIchakram  
  
Since each of these compositions glorifies one of the nine  
AvaraNams of the shrI chakram, we shall quickly describe the  
various geometrical components of the chakram. The shrI chakram,  
or the auspicious wheel is a geometrical diagram employed in  
the worship of Goddess tripurasundari, according to tantric  
traditions. It is more than a mere diagram, and has mystic  
powers and great significance in the shakti worship rituals.  
The outer portion of the shrI chakram consists of four units -  
the outermost gateway of three rectangular walls (bhUpura),  
three concentric circles (trivalaya, or vRRittatraya), a sixteen  
petaled rose ShoDashadaLa padma), and an eight-petaled rose  
(aShTadaLa padma). The core of the shakti group consists  
of 43 triangles-a set of fourteen triangles (manukoNa),  
two sets of ten triangles (bahirdashAra and antardashAra),  
a set of eight triangles (vasukoNa), and the innermost sole  
triangle (trikoNa). In fact these 43 triangles are formed  
by the intersections of four isosceles triangles with vertex  
pointing upwards (called the shiva group) , and five isosceles  
triangles with downward vertices (called the shakti group),  
all situated inside the eight petaled rose. The culmination  
of all these is the bindu, a single dot placed at the center.  
Each sub-chakram has its own presiding deity (devatA), as well  
as the subordinate deities (yoginis) associated with it.  
  
The nine AvaraNam-s of the shrIchakram  
  
1. bhUpuram - trailokya-mohana chakram

Ishitva, vashitva, prAkAmya, bhukti, ichchA, prApti,  
and sarvakAmA, reside, guarding the entrance. The middle  
line is aruNa (red), and is presided over by the eight  
mAtRRi shaktis - brAhmI,  
mAheshvarI, kaumArI, vaiShNavI,

Notes:    
  
This kRRiti contains the description of the first  
trailokyamohana chakra, also called bhUpura (or kshitipura). The  
chakra for this song consists of three rectangular walls, with  
openings on the four sides (in some versions of the diagrams,  
there is no opening, but sub-rectangles closing the entrance!)  
  
The song is set in the nominative case. The basic sentence  
unit (anvaya) is: kamalAMbA mAm saMrakShatu (May the Goddess  
Kamalamba protect me), and the various phrases qualify the  
proper noun Kamalamba.  
  
The eight Yogic accomplishments (siddhis) referred to in this song are :  
अणिमा  - power to become infinitesimal in size  
महिमा  - power to grow very huge  
लघिमा  - power to become very light  
गरिमा  - power to become inordinately heavy  
इशित्व  - power to rule over everything  
वशित्व  - power to subjugate all  
प्राप्ति  - power to obtain whatever is desired  
प्राकाम्य  - power to fulfil all wishes  
  
Nityas are the primary devatas (goddesses) of the first  
chakra. They are sixteen in number, kAmeshvari being at the  
center, and the other fifteen (bhagamAlini, nityaklinnA,  
bheruNDA, vahnivAsinI, mahAvajreshvarI, shivadUtI, tvaritA,  
kulasundarI, nityA, nIlapatAkA, vijayA, sarvama~NgaLA,  
jvAlAmAlinI, citrA and mahAnityA) around her. The shaktis  
residing in this chakra are called prakaTa yoginis.  
  
The phrase ``Ananda'' might have been used as a partial rAga  
mudrA for the rAga Anandabhairavi.

Notes:    
  
This song is in saptamI vibhakti (locative case). The basic  
sentence unit (anvaya) is ahaM kamalAMbikAyAM bhaktim karomi  
(I offer my devotion to the Goddess Kamalambika) and all  
adjectives with the ``yAM'' ending refer to kamalAmbikAyAM.  
  
The chakra for this song, sarvarogahara chakra, consists of  
eight triangles. The five elements are akAsha (space), vayu  
(air), tejas (fire), ap (water) and prthvi (earth).  
  
The forms of speech are four in number, according to the Indian  
grammatical tradition. First comes pure sound (parA vAk), which  
then manifests itself to the speaker (pashyantI). It then goes  
through an intermediate stage (madhyamA) of transformation,  
and is finally being expressed verbally (vaikharI).  
  
The eight shaktis, vashinyAdi mentioned here are: vashinI,  
kAmeshI, medinI, vimalA, aruNA, jayinI, sarveshI, and  
kauLinI. These shaktis are collectively called rahasya yogini-s.  
  
The rAga name Sahana appears as a mudrA in a slightly altered  
form as ``shAnA'' in the term ``harIshANa''.

This song employs all eight vibhaktis. The pallavi is in the  
nominative case, the first three lines of the anupallavi  
are in the accusative case and the rest of anupallavi is  
in the instrumental case. The first line of the charaNam is  
in the dative case, and also incorporates the vocative (in  
the word cinmAtre). The consecutive lines are in ablative,  
genitive and locative cases. The last two lines, meant to be  
sung in the madhyamakAla, are again in the nominative case,  
in order to return to the main pallavi line. The rAgamudrA  
``Ahiri'' is slightly altered as ``Ahari'' and occurs in  
the phrase ``ramAhari''.  
  
The chakra for this last AvaraNa, sarvAnandamaya chakram, is the  
bindu, the dot at the centre of the Srichakra. The shakti which  
resides in this chakra is known as parApara rahasya yogini.
