 दुर्गा पञ्चरत्नम्   
ते ध्यानयोगानुगता अपश्यन्  
     त्वामेव देवीं स्वगुणैर्निगूढाम् ।  
त्वमेव शक्तिः परमेश्वरस्य  
     मां पाहि सर्वेश्वरि मोक्षदात्रि ॥ १॥  
  
देवात्मशक्तिः श्रुतिवाक्यगीता  
     महर्षिलोकस्य पुरः प्रसन्ना ।  
गुहा परं व्योम सतः प्रतिष्ठा  
     मां पाहि सर्वेश्वरि मोक्षदात्रि ॥ २॥  
  
परास्य शक्तिः विविधैव श्रूयसे  
     श्वेताश्ववाक्योदितदेवि दुर्गे ।  
स्वाभाविकी ज्ञानबलक्रिया ते  
     मां पाहि सर्वेश्वरि मोक्षदात्रि ॥ ३॥  
  
देवात्मशब्देन शिवात्मभूता  
     यत्कूर्मवायव्यवचोविवृत्या ।  
त्वं पाशविच्छेदकरी प्रसिद्धा  
     मां पाहि सर्वेश्वरि मोक्षदात्रि ॥ ४॥  
  
त्वं ब्रह्मपुच्छा विविधा मयूरी  
     ब्रह्मप्रतिष्ठास्युपदिष्टगीता ।  
ज्ञानस्वरूपात्मतयाखिलानां  
     मां पाहि सर्वेश्वरि मोक्षदात्रि ॥ ५॥  
  
इति परमपूज्य श्री चन्द्रशेखरेन्द्र सरस्वती  
स्वामीगलकृतं दुर्गा पञ्चरत्नं सम्पूर्णम् ॥

Salutations to Durga  
  
Durga Pancharatnam Stotram Lyrics  
  
Those adopting meditation (Dhyana) and contemplation (yoga) saw, you as the only divine Goddess hidden in her own qualities and you are the only power behind the great God of the Universe, and so please protect me, oh Goddess of all and oh giver of salvation. 1  
  
You are the self-power of the Divine, sung about by the Vedas, delighted in front of great saints propitiating you, who have established yourselves in their hearts as Truth, and so please protect me, oh Goddess of all and oh giver of salvation. 2  
  
You are His Shakthi called Para, which is spoken in different ways, you are the one who is being celebrated by Shvetashvatara* Upanishad, you are by your nature, the power force in all actions and wisdom, and so please protect me, oh Goddess of all and oh giver of salvation. 3  
(This major Upanishad gives the basic teachings and concepts of Bhagawad Gita.)  
  
Formed by Self-power of sound of Shiva’s Aatma you are declared by sacred texts as the sound of Anahata, which exists in Kurma and Vayavya as Shakthi you are known as one cutting off worldly attachments (or the rope that drags you to death), and so please protect me, oh Goddess of all and oh giver of salvation. 4  
  
OM  
Anahata sabda – just before one enter Samadhi in yoga one can clearly hear Om inside which is not heard outside the physical body after this the person goes into Samadhi.  
Vayavya Dharana --  From the heart to the middle of the eyebrows is said to be the region of Vayu. It is black in color and shines with the letter ‘Ya’. Carrying the breath along the region of Vayu, one should contemplate on Ishvara, the omniscient. The Yogi does not meet his death through Vayu. ( Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta and Dhananjaya are the five sub-Pranas; Kurma performs the function of opening the eyes.)  
  
Hey Mayuri, you are praised as the route to Brahmam, you are the form of Brahamam established by the Bhagawad Gita too, you are the wisdom personified, enact the sport of creation and so please protect me, oh Goddess of all and oh giver of salvation. 5  
  
Mayuri - Durga worshiped Lord Shiva in the form of a peacock. And hence she is addressed as Mayuri.  
  
Gita -  ᳚For the changeless, eternal Brahmam, the Maya which is Shakti is the pratishta (that through which Brahmam spreads as the many worlds is called pratishta). I am That. I am the Brahmam; and I am its pratishta will be appropriate; because, there is a bhashyam that “Shakti Shaktimatoh Abhedat” (both the Shakti and the One who has it are not of different tatvam (nature).”  
  
This was composed by H H Sri Jagadguru Srimaan Chandrasekharendrendra Saraswathi of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham and is based on Shvetashvatara Upanishad.  Whoever recites this every day will attain moksha i.e liberation.
