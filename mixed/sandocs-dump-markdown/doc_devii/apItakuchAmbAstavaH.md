Note: Once Sri Appayya Dixita had gone to  
Tiruvannamalai for darshan of Lord Arunachalesvara.  
There he was laid up with severe fever. At that  
time he composed this poem and prayed to  
Goddess Apitakuchamba. He got immediate relief.  
Even now a devotee can get relief from  fever and  
other ailments by reciting this poem.  
  
A short life sketch of Shri Appayya DikShita (1520-1593 AD)  
Shrimad Appayya DikShita was born at Adayapalam village, very near  
Arni, North Arcot District, Tamil Nadu in the year  
1520 AD. His father Shri Rangarajadhari was the son of Shri Acharya  
DikShita - also known as VakShasthalacharya who was in  
the court of Shri Krishnadevaraya. Appayya was an  
endearing form of his real name, Vinayaka Subramaniam.  
The 16th century AD, in South India was an age of confusion  
when begotry and vigorous proselytism were rampant. Persecution of one sect by  
another with the help of the ruling dynasties  
was quite common. In such an age, the need was felt for a  
rare scholar with comprehensive vision and imagination, whose mission  
in life would be the reconciliation of the various creeds,  
cults and philosophies. Shri Appayya DikShita filled this essential  
need. He was a peace maker who pleade for harmony, tolera nce and mutual  
goodwill and understanding at a time when people were  
quarrelling among themselves as to who was superior Vishnu or Shiva. (Dr. N.  
Ramesan IAS. Shri Appayya DikShita Page 3)  
DikShitar's culture was at once profound, libeal and wide. His  
characteristic impartiality never failed him even in his out and  
out militant works.(A. V. Gopalachariar. Introduction to  
Varadarajastava 1927. P vI) DikShitar's learning, says Y. Mahalinga  
Shastri, was in the truest sense of the word encyclopaedic.\  
अप्पय्यदीक्षितेन्द्रा-नशेषविद्यागुरूनहं वन्दे । \  
यत्कृतिबोधाबोधौ विद्वदविद्वद्विभाजकोपाधी ॥ (भट्टोजीदीक्षितः)।\  
  
Shri DikShita is the author of not less than 104 works and had enjoyed  
the patronage of King Chinna Bomma of Vellore. He  
was offered kanakAbhiSheka by this king in 1582AD. He was  
patronised by Chinna Thimma and Venkatapati also. He  
lived upto the ripe age of 73 years and spent his last days in  
Chidambaram.  
  
Some of his most famous works are Shivarka maNidIpikA, NyAya  
rakShAmaNI, siddhAnta lesha sa.ngraha, parimala, chAturmata  
sArasa.ngraha, yAdavabhyudaya vyAkhyA, varadarAjastava and  
kuvalayAnanda. His stotras are simple, popular and effective,  
for example, mArgabandhu stotram, durgAchandrakalA stuti,  
ApitakuchambA stava, hariharabheda stuti.
