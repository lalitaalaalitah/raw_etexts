Before we begin, let us offer ourselves at the feet of  
the Divine Mother, mahAtripurasundarI, who as Ishvara rules the  
world but is none other than the indwelling spirit (Atman) within  
us and which pervades us all that exists.  
This introduction deals with the background on the name of  
tripurasundarI . It is one of the best epithets to describe the Devi  
meaning that she is the belle of all the three worlds . The word tripura  
can be interpreted variously . The kAlikA purANa says that by the will of  
pradhAna, the body of Lord Shiva became triple : the upper part became  
Brahma, the middle part became ViShNu and the lower part became Rudra . As  
these three pura-s (bodies) are in Lord Shiva, he is called Tripura (three  
bodied) and his wife is known as tripurA . In the kAmakalA vilAsa  
(13,14), the honored sage, abhiyukta, mentions that Devi created all the  
three forms and she is before all (purobhava), because she is in the form  
of all the three (trayImayi) and exists even after the dissolution of the  
three worlds and recreates them again . In the brahmANDa-purANa, it is  
mentioned that the Goddess tripurasundarI rules over the entire universe  
and She is the supreme empress, and Brahma, ViShNu and Shiva are mere  
functionaries in her empire . The LalitA SahasranAma portrays Her  
as being attended by LakShmi and Saraswati on either side.  
Shankaracharya, in his saundrayalahirI, mentions that Brahma, ViShNu  
and Shiva started  
their cosmic processes when the Supreme Shakti knitted Her brow for a  
split second.  
        The Devi mantra consists of three syllables, and her fifteen lettered  
mantra panchadashAkShari is composed of three kUTa-s (peaks).  
She resides in three nADi-s (nerve channels), namely suShumnA, pingalA, and  
iDA . She is the ruler of the three Shaktis - ichchA (will), kriyA  
(action), and j~nAna (knowledge). She pervades all the three worlds -  
heaven, earth and the nether world . She is the controller of all the three  
bodies - sthUla (gross), sUkShhma (subtle), and kAraNa (causal). She is  
the self which is present through the three states of existence - jAgrat  
(waking), svapna (dream), and suShupti (deep sleep). Though she is above  
all guNa-s, She pervades the three modes of energy- sattva (purity), rajas  
(mobility) and tamas (inertia).  
        Love and joy are the inherent qualities of beauty . SundarI means  
belle and beauty . Shankaracharya, while explaining Chandogya upaniShad 7,  
31:1, mentions that all longing and desire is a source of pain, and in what  
is finite there is no bliss . He mentions that the Infinite alone can  
produce bliss . When bliss takes on a form, it is sundarI: sarvA.nga  
sundarI (lalitA trishati, verse 130) and Shankara comments on  
this name of the  
Devi as the one who possesses all the marks of beauty and has all the  
qualities of perfection and is thus the source of Bliss.

May the Divine Mother guide us in our every action and thought, and may  
She confer upon us the greatest gift of all, mokSha (liberation) by removing  
the veil of maya which She weaves.  
At Her feet, OM tat sat
