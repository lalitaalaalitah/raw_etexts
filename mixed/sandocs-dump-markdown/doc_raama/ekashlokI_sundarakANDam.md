 एकश्लोकी सुन्दरकाण्डम्   
  
यस्य श्रीहनुमाननुग्रह बलात्तीर्णाम्बुधिर्लीलया  
लङ्कां प्राप्य निशाम्य रामदयिताम् भङ्क्त्वा वनं राक्षसान् ।  
अक्षादीन् विनिहत्य वीक्ष्य दशकम् दग्ध्वा पुरीं तां पुनः  
तीर्णाब्धिः कपिभिर्युतो यमनमत् तम् रामचन्द्रम्भजे ॥  
  
इति राघवेन्द्रस्वामिविरचितं एकश्लोकी सुन्दरकाण्डं सम्पूर्णम् ।  
  
  
I worship that Shri Rama, by whose grace, Shri Hanuman, who  
has Lakshmi kaTAkSha (grace), playfully crossed the ocean,  
reached Lanka after overcoming various obstacles, who after  
getting the status update from Sita (wife of Rama), destroyed  
the forest except Ashoka Vana, the place where sita resided,  
destroyed the entire army (about 80 crores) headed by Akshaya  
Kumaran, son of Ravana, by merely displaying the power of his  
palm, who after meeting Ravana in his chamber and burning Lanka  
into ashes, returned to Rama and worshiped Shri Rama along with  
other monkeys. (Dr S Vasudevan)  
  
Raghavendra Swami wrote the shloka summarizing sundarakANDam  
of rAmAyaNam which comprises of 2885 verses spread in 68 chapters.
